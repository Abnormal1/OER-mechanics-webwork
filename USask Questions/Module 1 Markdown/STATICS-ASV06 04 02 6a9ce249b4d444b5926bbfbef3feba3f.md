# Answer:

a) $-6\hat{i}+9\hat{j}$

b) $6\hat{i}-9\hat{j}$

c) $9\hat{i}-6\hat{j}$

d) $-9\hat{i}-6\hat{j}$

a) In two-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has two vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; and the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis. A vector in two-dimensional space is the vector sum of its two vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}$$

In this question, the vector is going in the positive x-direction and in the negative y-direction. So its x-component should be positive and its y-component should be negative.

b) Good job! In two-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has two vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; and the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis. A vector in two-dimensional space is the vector sum of its two vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}$$

c) In two-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has two vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; and the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis. A vector in two-dimensional space is the vector sum of its two vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}$$

In this answer, the component magnitudes are incorrect.  To determine the component magnitudes, take a projection of the tip of the vector up onto the x-axis for the x-component magnitude.  That would be 6 in this case.  Likewise, for the y-component magnitude, take a projection over to the y-axis, which would be -9 in this case.   

d) In two-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has two vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; and the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis. A vector in two-dimensional space is the vector sum of its two vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}$$

In this question, the vector is going in the positive x-direction and in the negative y-direction. So its x-component should be positive and its y-component should be negative.
