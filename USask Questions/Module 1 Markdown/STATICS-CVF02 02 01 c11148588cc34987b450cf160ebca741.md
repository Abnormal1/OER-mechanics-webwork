# Question:

In which direction does the unit vector $\hat{k}$ point?

# Answer:

a) The positive $x$ direction

b) The positive $y$ direction

c) The positive $z$ direction

d) Not enough information

# Feedback:

a) The unit vector $\hat{k}$ points along the positive $z$ axis. 

b) The unit vector $\hat{k}$ points along the positive $z$ axis. 

c) Correct! The unit vector $\hat{k}$ points along the positive $z$ axis. 

d) Because $\hat{k}$ is a **unit vector**, we have enough information by its definition to know which direction it points i.e. it points along the positive $z$ axis.
