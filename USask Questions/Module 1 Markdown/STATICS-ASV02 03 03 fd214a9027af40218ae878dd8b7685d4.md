# Automatic Feedback:

a. One can use the parallelogram law to subtract two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. **D1**-**D2**=**D1**+(-**D2**). (-**D2)** has the same magnitude as **D2** but in the opposite direction. If vector D1 and vector (-D2) are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point as **D1** and (-**D2)** is the resultant of adding vectors D1 and (-D2). In this answer, the parallelogram rule is not used to add **D1** and (-**D2).** If this explanation doesn’t help, please go to <a location where all the links are> for further assistance and then try this quiz again when you feel ready to do so.

b. One can use the parallelogram law to subtract two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. **D1**-**D2**=**D1**+(-**D2**). (-**D2)** has the same magnitude as **D2** but in the opposite direction. If vector D1 and vector (-D2) are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point as **D1** and (-**D2)** is the resultant of adding vectors D1 and (-D2).  In this answer, the direction of (-**D2)** is not correct.  The vector arrow on (-**D2)** should be going in the opposite direction.
