# Answer:

a. positive

b. 0

c. negative

# Feedback:

a. The dot product of two vectors is based on the projection of one vector onto another. it is defined by the equation:

$$⁍$$

Thus, the dot product would be positive if the two vectors are pointing in similar directions $(\theta<90^\circ)$ , zero if they are perpendicular, and negative if the two vectors are pointing in nearly opposite directions $(90^\circ\lt\theta<180^\circ)$. In this question, both the red and blue vectors are lying in the x-y plane, and the angle between each vector and the x-axis is 45 degrees. Thus the angle between these two vectors is 90 degrees and the dot product is zero.

b. Well done! The dot product of two vectors is based on the projection of one vector onto another. it is defined by the equation:

$$⁍$$

Thus, the dot product would be positive if the two vectors are pointing in similar directions $(\theta<90^\circ)$ , zero if they are perpendicular, and negative if the two vectors are pointing in nearly opposite directions $(90^\circ\lt\theta<180^\circ)$. In this question, both the red and blue vectors are lying in the x-y plane, and the angle between each vector and the x-axis is 45 degrees. Thus the angle between these two vectors is 90 degrees and the dot product is zero.
