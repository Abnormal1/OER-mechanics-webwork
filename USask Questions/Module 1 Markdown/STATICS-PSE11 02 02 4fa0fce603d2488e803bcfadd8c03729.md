# Question:

Given the following **scalar** equations of equilibrium:

$$\sum\overrightarrow{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum{F}_y=0$$

Choose from the list below as to what should be fixed so that the above statements are correct. 

a) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be added to ${F}_y$

b) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be removed from $\overrightarrow{F}_x$

c) The sum of both should equal zero, not each separately

d) The subscripts should be removed, the $x$ and $y$ directions don't matter

# Answer:

b) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be removed from $\overrightarrow{F}_x$

# Feedback:

a) Because we are interested in the **scalar** equations of equilibrium, we want to express both ${F}_x$ and ${F}_y$ as scalars, not vectors. 

b) Correct!  For correct scalar notation, the first term $\overrightarrow{F}_x$ needs the vector symbol removed to become $F_x$.

c) The sum of all the scalar force components in the $x$ direction must equal zero **separately** from all of the scalar force components in the $y$ direction. 

d) The subscripts actually matter very much. The sum of all the scalar force components in the $x$ direction must equal zero **separately** from all of the scalar force components in the $y$ direction.
