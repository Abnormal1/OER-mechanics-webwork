# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

A washer on the edge of a shelf supports three different forces: $F_1=700\;\mathrm{lb}$, $F_2=400\;\mathrm{lb}$, and $F_3=600\;\mathrm{lb}$, as shown. The angle between $F_1$ and the positive $x$ axis, $\phi_1$, is $30\degree$. What is the resultant force vector experienced by the washer, expressed in Cartesian form?

From the list below, select **all the correct assumptions** that should be made in order to solve the above problem: 

# Answer:

d) Given information is exact

e) The system is in static equilibrium

i) The pin is modelled as a particle

# Feedback:

The **assumptions** section of your submission must list all pertinent assumptions that have beenmade in order to solve the problem. A thorough list of assumptions should be viewed as part of the answer to the problem. The numerical values you calculate are only useful if the assumptions used to obtain them are clear. In engineering practice, clarity about the conditions under which a numerical value was calculated is **very** important to ensure the value is not used under conditions where it is not valid.

Think about the assumptions presented. Do they all apply to the problem as stated? Are all the assumptions relevant to this particular situation? Of the ones that are relevant, do they make a true statement about the assumptions we need to solve the problem? Have you selected all the assumptions necessary for the given information? All of these questions must be considered when framing the assumptions of a problem. 

Note that there are no ropes or springs in the problem, the value of g is not needed, the pin is best regarded as a particle and is therefore not rigid, and while the pin could be considered frictionless, there is no clear need to assume that in this case.
