# Feedback:

a. An object can be treated as a particle when its physical dimensions are of no significance to the analysis of forces acting on it. It is not necessarily a small object, but the forces acting on it must be concurrent to the object's centroid. In this answer, the lines of action of the forces do not intersect with each other. 

b. Good job! An object can be treated as a particle when its physical dimensions are of no significance to the analysis of forces acting on it. It is not necessarily a small object, but the forces acting on it must be concurrent to the object's centroid. 

c. The size of the object is irrelevant to whether it can be treated as a particle. An object can be treated as a particle when its physical dimensions are of no significance to the analysis of forces acting on it. It is not necessarily a small object, but the forces acting on it must be concurrent to the object's centroid.
