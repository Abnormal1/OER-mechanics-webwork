# Question:

Given the angle between two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, is $90 ^\circ$, what is the magnitude of the projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ onto $\overrightarrow{B}$? 

# Answer:

a. $|\overrightarrow{A}|$

b. $|\overrightarrow{B}|$

c. $0$

d. Not enough information.

# Feedback:

a. The projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ to $\overrightarrow{B}$ can be calculated as $|\overrightarrow{A}|\text{cos}(\theta ^\circ)$, where $\theta^\circ$ represents the angle between these two vectors.  If $\theta=90^\circ$, then $\text{cos}(\theta ^\circ)=0$.  Thus, the projection of one vector onto the other one should also be zero.

b. The projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ to $\overrightarrow{B}$ can be calculated as $|\overrightarrow{A}|\text{cos}(\theta ^\circ)$, where $\theta^\circ$ represents the angle between these two vectors.  If $\theta=90^\circ$, then $\text{cos}(\theta ^\circ)=0$.  Thus, the projection of one vector onto the other one should also be zero.

c. Great! For two vectors perpendicular to each other, the projection of one vector onto the other one should be zero. 

d. The projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ to $\overrightarrow{B}$ can be calculated as $|\overrightarrow{A}|\text{cos}(\theta ^\circ)$, where $\theta^\circ$ represents the angle between these two vectors.  If $\theta=90^\circ$, then $\text{cos}(\theta ^\circ)=0$.  Thus, the projection of one vector onto the other one should also be zero.
