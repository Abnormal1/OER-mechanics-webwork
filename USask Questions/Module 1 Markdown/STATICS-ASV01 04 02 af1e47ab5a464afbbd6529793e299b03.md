# Automatic Feedback:

a. Correct. One can use the parallelogram law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. If vector D1 and vector D2 are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point of **D1** and **D2** is the resultant (vector R) of adding vectors D1 and D2.

b. One can use the parallelogram law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. If vector D1 and vector D2 are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point of **D1** and **D2** is the resultant (vector R) of adding vectors D1 and D2. For this option, both vectors are not directed from the POSITIVE x axis.

c. One can use the parallelogram law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. If vector D1 and vector D2 are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point of **D1** and **D2** is the resultant (vector R) of adding vectors D1 and D2. Also, the tails of the vectors (**D1** and **D2**) should start at the origin (unless told otherwise).
