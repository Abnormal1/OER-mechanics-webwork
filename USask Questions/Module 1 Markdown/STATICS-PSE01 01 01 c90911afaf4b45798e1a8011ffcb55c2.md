# Question:

The free body diagram below shows two forces, $\overrightarrow{F_1}$ and $\overrightarrow{W}$, acting on a particle at rest. Knowing the two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, determine if the particle is in static equilibrium.

- [ ]  Yes

# Answer:

Yes

# Feedback:

We say that an object is in static equilibrium if it is originally at rest and remains at rest. This requires that all the forces acting on the object form a zero resultant force. The simplest case of static equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
