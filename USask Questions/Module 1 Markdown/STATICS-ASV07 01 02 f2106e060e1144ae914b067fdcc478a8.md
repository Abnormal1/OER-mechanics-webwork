# Question:

For a vector with a magnitude of $[A]$ N directed along the positive $x$-axis, select the correct representation of this vector in Cartesian form.

Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (1, 20), 0 decimal places

# Answer:

a. $\overrightarrow{v}=\left([A]\hat{i}+0\hat{j}\right) \mathrm{N}$

b. $\overrightarrow{v}=\left(-[A]\hat{i}+0\hat{j}\right) \mathrm{N}$

c. $\overrightarrow{v}=\left(0\hat{i}+[A]\hat{j}\right) \mathrm{N}$

d. $\overrightarrow{v}=\left(0\hat{i}-[A]\hat{j}\right) \mathrm{N}$

# Feedback:

a. Good job! This vector is pointing along the positive $x$-axis, thus, the angle between this vector and the positive $x$-axis is 0 degrees.

To find the $x$ component from the magnitude and angle of a vector, multiply the magnitude by the cosine of the angle. That would be [A] N in this case.

To find the $y$ component from the magnitude and angle of a vector, multiply the magnitude by the sine of the angle. That would be 0 N in this case.

b. This vector is pointing along the positive $x$-axis, thus, the angle between this vector and the positive $x$-axis is 0 degrees.

To find the $x$ component from the magnitude and angle of a vector, multiply the magnitude by the cosine of the angle. That would be [A] N in this case.

To find the $y$ component from the magnitude and angle of a vector, multiply the magnitude by the sine of the angle. That would be 0 N in this case.
