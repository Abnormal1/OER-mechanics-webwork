# Question:

The free body diagram below shows two forces, $\overrightarrow{F_1}$ and $\overrightarrow{W}$, acting on a particle at rest. Knowing both forces are acting vertically and the magnitudes of the two forces are [A] N and [B] N, respectively, determine if the particle is in static equilibrium.

- [ ]  Yes
- [ ]  No

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (3, 11) in steps of 1

$[B]=[A]+1$

# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

We say that an object is in static equilibrium if it is originally at rest and remains at rest. This requires that all the forces acting on the object form a zero resultant force. In this question, the resultant force is 1 N directed downward.
