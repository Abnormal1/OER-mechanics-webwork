# Answer:

Yes

# Feedback:

We say that an object is in equilibrium if it remains at rest if originally at rest, or has a constant velocity if originally in motion. This requires that all the forces acting on the object form a zero resultant force. The simplest case of equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
