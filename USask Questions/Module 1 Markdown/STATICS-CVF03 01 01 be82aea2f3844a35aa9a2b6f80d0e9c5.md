# Answer:

a. $\vec{V}=2\hat{i}+3\hat{j}+4\hat{k}$

b. $\vec{V}=2\hat{i}+4\hat{j}+3\hat{k}$

c. $\vec{V}=2\hat{i}-3\hat{j}+4\hat{k}$

d. $\vec{V}=2\hat{i}+3\hat{j}-4\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a. Good job! In three-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has three vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis; and the *z-*component $\vec{A_z}=A_z\hat{k}$, which is the part of the vector along the *z-*axis. A vector in three-dimensional space is the vector sum of its three vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}+A_z\hat{k}$$

b. In three-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has three vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis; and the *z-*component $\vec{A_z}=A_z\hat{k}$, which is the part of the vector along the *z-*axis. A vector in three-dimensional space is the vector sum of its three vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}+A_z\hat{k}$$

In this answer, the component magnitudes are incorrect.  To determine the component magnitudes, take projections of the tip of the vector over to the x-. y- and z-axis, respectively.  Alternatively, you can take a projection of the vector down to the x-y plane. Then, read the projection like a 2D vector.

c. In three-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has three vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis; and the *z-*component $\vec{A_z}=A_z\hat{k}$, which is the part of the vector along the *z-*axis. A vector in three-dimensional space is the vector sum of its three vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}+A_z\hat{k}$$

In this question, the vector is going in the positive x-, y- and z-direction. So all of its components should be positive.

d. In three-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has three vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis; and the *z-*component $\vec{A_z}=A_z\hat{k}$, which is the part of the vector along the *z-*axis. A vector in three-dimensional space is the vector sum of its three vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}+A_z\hat{k}$$

In this question, the vector is going in the positive x-, y- and z-direction. So all of its components should be positive.
