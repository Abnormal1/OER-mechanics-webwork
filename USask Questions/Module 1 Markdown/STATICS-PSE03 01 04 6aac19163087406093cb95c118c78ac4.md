# Question:

Given two forces acting on a particle at rest, $\overrightarrow{F_1}=([A]\hat{i}+0\hat{j})~\text{N}$ and $\overrightarrow{F_2}=(-[A]]\hat{i}+0\hat{j})~\text{N}$, is the particle in static equilibrium.

- [ ]  Yes
- [ ]  No

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (3, 11) in steps of 1

# Answer:

Yes

# Feedback:

We say that an object is in static equilibrium if it is originally at rest and remains at rest. This requires that all the forces acting on the object form a zero resultant force. In this question, 

$$\overrightarrow{W}+\overrightarrow{F_1}=(([A]\hat{i}+0\hat{j})~\text{N}+(-[A]\hat{i}+0\hat{j})~\text{N}=(0\hat{i}+0\hat{j})~\text{N}$$

Therefore, the particle is in static equilibrium.
