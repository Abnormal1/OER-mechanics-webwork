# Answer:

a) Infinity, $z$

b) One, $y$

c) Zero, $x$

d) One, $z$

# Feedback:

a) That is the correct **direction** for the unit vector $\hat{k}$ but it has a length of **one**. 

b) That is the correct **length** for the unit vector $\hat{k}$ but it is directed along the positive $**z**$ axis.

c) A unit vector has a length of **one** and the unit vector $\hat{k}$ is directed along the positive $**z**$ axis.

d) Correct! The unit vector $\hat{k}$ has length **ONE** and is directed along the positive $**z**$ axis.
