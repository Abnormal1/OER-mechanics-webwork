# Question:

Select the multiple choice answer that best fills in the blank:

"A **unit vector** is a(n) _________ spatial vector that has a length of one."

# Answer:

a) Imaginary

b) Infinite

c) Finite 

d) Normalized

# Feedback:

a) A unit vector is real, and is **normalized** to unit length. 

b) A unit vector is finite, and is **normalized** to unit length. 

c) While a unit vector is finite, the important part of this definition is that it is **normalized** to unit length.

d) Correct! A unit vector is **normalized** to unit length.
