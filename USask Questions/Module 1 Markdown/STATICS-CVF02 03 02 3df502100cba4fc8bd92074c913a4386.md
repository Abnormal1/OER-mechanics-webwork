# Question:

Select the multiple choice answer that best fills in the blanks:

"The unit vector $\hat{j}$ has a length of _______ and is directed along the positive _____ axis."

# Answer:

a) Infinity, $x$

b) One, $y$

c) One, $z$

d) Zero, $y$

# Feedback:

a) A unit vector has a length of **one** and the unit vector $\hat{j}$ is directed along the positive $**y**$ axis.

b) Correct! The unit vector $\hat{j}$ has length **ONE** and is directed along the positive $**y**$ axis.

c) That is the correct **length** for the unit vector $\hat{j}$ but it is directed along the positive $**y**$ axis.

d) That is the correct **direction** for the unit vector $\hat{j}$ but it has a length of **one**.
