- [ ]  Yes
- [ ]  No

# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

We say that an object is in equilibrium if it remains at rest if originally at rest, or has a constant velocity if originally in motion. This requires that all the forces acting on the object form a zero resultant force. The resultant force in this question does not equal to zero. Thus, the particle is NOT in equilibrium.
