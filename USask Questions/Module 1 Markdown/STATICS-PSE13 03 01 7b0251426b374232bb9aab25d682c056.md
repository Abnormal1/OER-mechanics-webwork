# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The hook depicted in the image below has two ropes pulling on it. What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes?

Assume that the correct numerical answer to the problem above is $212.55246$.  From the list below, select **all the correct options** depicting the correct presentation of the **conclusion** with correct notation. 

"The magnitude of the resultant force acting on the screw force due to the two ropes is _____________."

a) $\overrightarrow{F_R}=213\;\mathrm{N}$

b) $F_R=213\;\mathrm{N}$

c) $|\overrightarrow{F_R}|=213\;\mathrm{N}$

d) $\bold{F}_R=213\;\mathrm{N}$

# Answer:

b) $F_R=213\;\mathrm{N}$

c) $|\overrightarrow{F_R}|=213\;\mathrm{N}$

# Feedback:

The conclusion to a problem must be given with correct notation. It is common to confuse vector notation with scalar notation. Note the following accepted notations for both:

$$\mathrm{vector}:\overrightarrow{A}\;\mathrm{or}\;\bold{A}$$

$$\mathrm{scalar}:|\overrightarrow{A}|\;\mathrm{or}\;A$$

Scalar values are typically represented with a simple variable symbol, e.g. $A$, but can be represented as the magnitude of a vector, e.g. $|\overrightarrow{A}|$.
