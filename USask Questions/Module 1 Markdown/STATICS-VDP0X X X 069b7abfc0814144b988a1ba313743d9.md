# Question:

Calculate the dot product of $\overrightarrow{A}=([X]\hat{i}+[Y]\hat{j}+[Z]\hat{k})$ and $\overrightarrow{B}=([O]\hat{i}+[P]\hat{j}+[Q]\hat{k})$. 

Enter your answer: ________

### Variable Parameters

$[X]:$ Range (-8, 8) in steps of 2

$[Y]:$ Range (-8, 8) in steps of 2

$[Z]:$ Range (-8, 8) in steps of 2

$[O]:$ Range (-9, 9) in steps of 2

$[P]:$ Range (-9, 9) in steps of 2

$[Q]:$ Range (-9, 9) in steps of 2

# Answer:

$$⁍$$

# Feedback:

The dot product of two vectors is based on the projection of one vector onto another.  It is defined by the equation:

$$⁍$$

However, if the components of the vectors are known, for example, $\overrightarrow{A}=(A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}+A_z\hat{k)}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}=(B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}+B_z\hat{k)}$, then the dot product of $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$ can also be calculated as:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}=A_x\cdot B_x+A_y \cdot B_y+A_z\cdot B_z$$
