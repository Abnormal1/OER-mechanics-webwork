# Question:

Given the stated vector equation of equilibrium:

$$\sum\overrightarrow{F}_x=0$$

Choose from the list below as to what should be fixed so that the above statement is correct. 

a) The subscript, $x$, should be removed from to $\overrightarrow{F}_x$

b) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be removed from $\overrightarrow{F}_x$

c) There should be another equation for $\overrightarrow{F}_y$

d) The summation sign, $\Sigma$, should be removed

# Answer:

a) The subscript, $x$, should be removed from to $\overrightarrow{F}_x$

# Feedback:

a) Correct! The correct vector equation (singular) should be the summation of the force vectors $\overrightarrow{F}$, which includes the $x$ and $y$ components. 

b) If we remove the vector symbol from the variable, $\overrightarrow{F}_x$, then we will have a scalar component $F_x$, and this equation needs to be in vector form.  It also needs to include the y components.

c) The correct vector equation (singular) includes both $x$ and $y$ components, so the $\overrightarrow{F}_x$ and $\overrightarrow{F}_y$ terms don't need to be stated independently, even though together they would represent valid equations (plural) of equilibrium.

d) The summation sign is an important part of the equilibrium equation so that we know to add all components of forces together.  We also need to account for y components.
