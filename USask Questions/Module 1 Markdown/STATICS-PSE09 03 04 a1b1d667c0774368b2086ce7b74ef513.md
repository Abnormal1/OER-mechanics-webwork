# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

A washer on the edge of a shelf supports three different forces: $F_1=700\;\mathrm{lb}$, $F_2=400\;\mathrm{lb}$, and $F_3=600\;\mathrm{lb}$, as shown. The angle between $F_1$ and the positive $x$ axis, $\phi_1$, is $30\degree$. What is the resultant force vector experienced by the washer, expressed in Cartesian form?

From the list below, select **the correct option** depicting the information that you need to **find** in the above problem.  

a) the magnitude of $F_2$ 

b) the magnitude and direction of the resultant force vector experienced by the washer

c) the angle between $F_1$ and the positive $x$ axis, $\phi_1$

d) the resultant force vector experienced by the washer, expressed in Cartesian form

# Answer:

d) the resultant force vector experienced by the washer, expressed in Cartesian form

# Feedback:

a) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The magnitude of $F_2$ is given in the written description of the problem statement, along with $F_1$ and $F_3$, even though they aren't stated on the diagram. 

b) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. While the problem statement is asking for the resultant force vector, it is not asking for the magnitude and direction. 

c) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement gives the value of $\phi_1$ in the written description, even though it is not stated on the diagram. 

d) Good job! This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement asks for the resultant force vector in Cartesian form, all of which is necessary information for you to find.
