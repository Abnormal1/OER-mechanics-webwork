# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The ring at point $A$ is attached by a spring to the wall at point $C$ and a by a rope to another wall at point $B$, while being pulled by a second rope with force $F=600\;\mathrm{N}$. The spring $AC$ has a spring constant $k_{AC}=20\;\mathrm{N/m}$.  What is the unstretched length of the spring $AC$?

Assume that the correct numerical answer to the problem above is $0.6601955$. From the list below, select the best presentation of the **conclusion** with the correct number of significant figures. 

"The unstretched length of the spring $AC$ is  _____________."

a) $0.660\;\mathrm{m}$

b) $0.66\;\mathrm{m}$

c) $0.6602\;\mathrm{m}$

d) $0.661\;\mathrm{m}$

# Answer:

a) $0.660\;\mathrm{m}$

# Feedback:

a) Good job! The numerical conclusion to a problem must be stated to three significant figures. 

b) The numerical conclusion to a problem must be stated to three significant figures.  This answer only has two significant figures.

c) The numerical conclusion to a problem must be stated to three significant figures.  This answer has four significant figures.

d) The numerical conclusion to a problem must be stated to three significant figures.  While this answer does have three significant figures, the answer was not rounded correctly.
