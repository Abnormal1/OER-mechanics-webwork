# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The ring at point $A$ is attached by a spring to the wall at point $C$ and a by a rope to another wall at point $B$, while being pulled by a second rope with force $F=600\;\mathrm{N}$. The spring $AC$ has an unstretched length of $0.65\;\mathrm{m}$.  What is the spring constant, $k_{AC}$?

Assume that the correct numerical answer to the problem above is $19.84661$. From the list below, select the option ****depicting the correct presentation of the **conclusion** with the appropriate labels. 

"The spring constant  _____________."

a) $K_{AC}=19.8\;\mathrm{N/m}$

b) $k_{ac}=19.8\;\mathrm{N/m}$

c) $k_{AC}=19.8\;\mathrm{N/m}$

d) $k=19.8\;\mathrm{N/m}$

# Answer:

c) $k_{AC}=19.8\;\mathrm{N/m}$

# Feedback:

a) The conclusion to a problem must be given with correct notation.  Upper case and lower case letters have different meanings as variable names, so make sure the case is correct. 

b) The conclusion to a problem must be given with correct notation.  Upper case and lower case letters have different meanings as variable names, so make sure the case is correct. 

c) Correct! The conclusion to a problem must be given with correct notation. This answer has the same variable name as given in the written description, and as in the diagram. 

d) The conclusion to a problem must be given with correct notation. Subscripts and superscripts are important parts of variable names - make sure you're not missing any!
