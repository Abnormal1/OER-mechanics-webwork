# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

We say that an object is in equilibrium if it remains at rest if originally at rest, or has a constant velocity if originally in motion. This requires that all the forces acting on the object form a zero resultant force.  In this question, $\overrightarrow{F_2}$ can be resolved into its horizontal and vertical components:

$$\overrightarrow{F_{2x}}=10~\text{N}\times\frac{3}{5}=6 ~\text{N} \rightarrow$$

$$\overrightarrow{F_{2y}}=10~\text{N}\times\frac{4}{5}=8 ~\text{N} \uparrow$$

We can see that $\overrightarrow{F_{2y}}$  and $\overrightarrow{W}$ are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. However, $\overrightarrow{F_{2x}}$ does not have the same magnitude as $\overrightarrow{F_1}$, which means the net force in the x-direction is not zero. Thus, the particle is NOT in equilibrium.
