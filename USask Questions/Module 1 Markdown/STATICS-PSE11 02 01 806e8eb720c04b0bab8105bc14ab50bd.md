# Question:

From the options below, select the correct set of equations that govern 2D particle static equilibrium, in terms of **scalar** notation.

a) $\sum{F}=0$

b) $\sum\overrightarrow{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum\overrightarrow{F}_y=0$

c) $\sum{F}_x+\sum{F}_y=0$

d) $\sum{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum{F}_y=0$

# Answer:

d) $\sum{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum{F}_y=0$

# Feedback:

a) While this answer does provide correct scalar notation, the sum of all the scalar force vectors in the $x$ direction must equal zero **separately** from all of the force vectors in the $y$ direction. 

b) While this answer has the correct separation of forces in the $x$ direction and the $y$ direction, the notation is for vector forces.   The question asks for scalar notation.

c) While this answer does provide the correct scalar notation, the sum of all the scalar force components in the $x$ direction must equal zero **separately** from all of the scalar force components in the $y$ direction. 

d) Correct! The sum of all the scalar force components in the $x$ direction must equal zero, as well as all of the scalar force components in the $y$ direction.
