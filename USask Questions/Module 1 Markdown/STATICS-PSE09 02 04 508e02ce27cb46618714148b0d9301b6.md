# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

A washer on the edge of a shelf supports three different forces on it, $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$, as shown. What is the resultant force vector experienced by the washer, expressed in Cartesian form?

From the list below, select **the correct option** depicting the information that you need to **find** in the above problem.  

a) the resultant force vector experienced by the washer, expressed in Cartesian form

b) the height of $F_2$, given by $y$

c) the resultant force vector experienced by the washer

d) the angle between $F_3$ and the negative $x$ axis

# Answer:

a) the resultant force vector experienced by the washer, expressed in Cartesian form

# Feedback:

a) Good job! This question asks you to identify what it is that you are required to **Find** in the problem.  This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement asks for the resultant force vector in Cartesian form, all of which is necessary information for you to find. 

b) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are required to **Find** in the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. There is no such thing as a "height" of a force, nor is the symbol $y$ used as a variable here. Remember that $y$  and $x$ are used to label the coordinate axes. 

c) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are required to **Find** in the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. While the problem statement is asking for the resultant force vector, there is a form in which it must be expressed. More information is needed!

d) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are required to **Find** in the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does not ask for you to find any angles, even though the angle between $F_3$ and the negative $x$ axis isn't explicitly given.
