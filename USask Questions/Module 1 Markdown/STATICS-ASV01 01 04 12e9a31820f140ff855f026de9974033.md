# Automatic Feedback:

a. Correct. One can use the parallelogram law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. If vector D1 and vector D2 are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point of **D1** and **D2** is the resultant of vectors D1 and D2. 

b. One can use the parallelogram law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. If vector D1 and vector D2 are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point of **D1** and **D2** is the resultant of vectors D1 and D2. In this answer, **D2** is facing the wrong direction, given the information provided in the question.
