a. Good job! An object can be treated as a particle when its physical dimensions are of no significance to the analysis of forces acting on it. It is not necessarily a small object, but the forces acting on it must be concurrent to a single point. 

b. An object can be treated as a particle when its physical dimensions are of no significance to the analysis of forces acting on it. It is not necessarily a small object, but the forces acting on it must be concurrent to a single point. In this answer, the lines of action of the forces do not meet at the same point.
