# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

If a downward force of $F=450\;\mathrm{lb}$ is applied to point $A$ in the strut system shown below, what is the force vector directed along strut $**A$$B$** in Cartesian form?  The angle between the struts $\theta_A$ is $30\degree$and the angle between strut $AB$ and the downward force $F$ is $\theta_F=45\degree$.

Assume that the correct numerical answer to the problem above is $155.3202$ in the $x$ direction and $389.2256$ in the $y$ direction.  From the list below, select all correct depictions of the **conclusion** with correct notation. 

"The force vector directed along strut $A$$B$ in Cartesian form is _____________."

a) $|\overrightarrow{F}_{AB}|=(-155\hat{i}-389\hat{j})\;\mathrm{lb}$

b) $\overrightarrow{F}_{AB}=(-155\hat{i}-389\hat{j})\;\mathrm{lb}$

c) $\bold{F}_{AB}=(-155\hat{i}-389\hat{j})\;\mathrm{lb}$

d) ${F}_{AB}=(-155\hat{i}-389\hat{j})\;\mathrm{lb}$

# Answer:

b) $\overrightarrow{F}_{AB}=(-155\hat{i}-389\hat{j})\;\mathrm{lb}$

c) $\bold{F}_{AB}=(-155\hat{i}-389\hat{j})\;\mathrm{lb}$

# Feedback:

The conclusion to a problem must be given with correct notation.  It is common to confuse vector notation with scalar notation.  Note the following accepted notations for both:

$$\mathrm{vector}:\overrightarrow{A}\;\mathrm{or}\;\bold{A}$$

$$\mathrm{scalar}:|\overrightarrow{A}|\;\mathrm{or}\;A$$

Scalar values are typically represented with a simple variable symbol, e.g. $A$, but can be represented as the magnitude of a vector, e.g. $|\overrightarrow{A}|$, if the value is a magnitude.
