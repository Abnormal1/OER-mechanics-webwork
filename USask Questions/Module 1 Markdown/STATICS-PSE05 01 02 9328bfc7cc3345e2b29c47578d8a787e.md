# Feedback:

a. An object can be treated as a particle when its physical dimensions are of no significance to the analysis of forces acting on it. It is not necessarily a small object, but the forces acting on it must be concurrent to a single point. In this answer, the lines of action of the forces intersect at two different points. 

b. Good job! This is one of the correct answers. An object can be treated as a particle when its physical dimensions are of no significance to the analysis of forces acting on it. It is not necessarily a small object, but the forces acting on it must be concurrent to a single point. 

c. The size of the object is irrelevant to whether it can be treated as a particle. An object can be treated as a particle when its physical dimensions are of no significance to the analysis of forces acting on it. It is not necessarily a small object, but the forces acting on it must be concurrent to a single point. 

d. Well done! This is one of the correct answers. An object can be treated as a particle if there is only one force acting on it.
