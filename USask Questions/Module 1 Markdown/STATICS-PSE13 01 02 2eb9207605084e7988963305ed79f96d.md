# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

If a downward force of $450\;\mathrm{lb}$ is applied to point $A$ in the strut system shown below, what is the force along the strut directed from point $A$ to point $B$?

Assume that the correct numerical answer to the problem above is $318.1980515$.  From the list below, select the best ****presentation of the **conclusion** with appropriate units. 

"The force along the strut directed from point $A$ to point $B$ is _____________."

a) $318\;\mathrm{kg}$

b) $318\;\mathrm{N}$

c) $318\;\mathrm{lb}$

# Answer:

c) $318\;\mathrm{lb}$

# Feedback:

a) The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units.  Kilograms ($\mathrm{kg}$) are a unit of mass, not force, so these are not the correct units. 

b) The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units. While the units shown in this answer can be used for force, these are not the force units used in the problem.

c) Good job! The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units. Because the forces in the problem were given in terms of pounds, the resultant force should also be presented in pounds using the correct symbol, $\mathrm{lb}$.
