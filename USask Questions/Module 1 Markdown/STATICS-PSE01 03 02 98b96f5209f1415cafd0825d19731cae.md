# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

We say that an object is in equilibrium if it remains at rest if originally at rest, or has a constant velocity if originally in motion. This requires that all the forces acting on the object form a zero resultant force. In this question, $\overrightarrow{F_2}$ can be resolved into its horizontal and vertical components:

$$\overrightarrow{F_{2x}}=\overrightarrow{F_2}\times\cos(60^\circ)=10~\text{N}\times\frac{1}{2}=5 ~\text{N} \rightarrow$$

$$\overrightarrow{F_{2y}}=\overrightarrow{F_2}\times\sin(60^\circ)=10~\text{N}\times\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}=5\sqrt{3} ~\text{N} \uparrow$$

We can see that $\overrightarrow{F_{2x}}$  and $\overrightarrow{F_1}$ are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. However, $\overrightarrow{F_{2y}}$ does not have the same magnitude with $\overrightarrow{W}$, which means the net force in the y-direction is not zero. Thus, the particle is NOT in equilibrium.
