# Question:

Consider vectors **A** and **B** in the diagram below: 

![STATICS-ASV08%2001%2003%2011d9f58dcaee4a2795a196e683a75ea8/Untitled.png](STATICS-ASV08%2001%2003%2011d9f58dcaee4a2795a196e683a75ea8/Untitled.png)

Find the resultant vector **C** as a sum of vectors **A** and **B.** Fill in the blanks below to express the vector in the Cartesian form: 

$$\bold{C}=\_\_\hat{i}+\_\_\hat{j}$$

# Answer:

$$C_x=-5; \qquad C_y=-5$$

# Feedback:

The addition of two vectors involves adding the $x$ components and $y$ components of each vector respectively. We must first determine the $x$ and $y$ components of each vector $\bold{A}$ and $\bold{B}$ from the graph, then add those together to get the resultant vector $\bold{C}$. 

$$\bold{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}$$

$$\bold{B}=B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}$$

$$\bold{C}=\bold{A}+\bold{B}=\left(A_x+B_x\right)\hat{i}+\left(A_y+B_y\right)\hat{j}$$
