# Feedback:

a. In this answer, the weight of the block is missing. 

b. Well done. Since the original lengths of the springs are shorter than the current lengths, both of the springs should be in tension and we can't forget about the weight of the block. 

c. Since the original lengths of the springs are shorter than the current lengths, both of the springs should be in tension. 

d. Since the original lengths of the springs  are shorter than the current lengths, both of the springs should be in tension.
