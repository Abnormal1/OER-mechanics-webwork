# Automatic Feedback:

a. Correct. One can use the triangle law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and (-**D2)**.  If vector D1 and vector (-D2) are two sides of a triangle, then the third side of this triangle (which starts at the tail of **D1,** goes to the tail of (-**D2)**, and then goes to the tip of (-**D2))** is the resultant (**R**) of adding **D1** and (-**D2)**.  

b. One can use the triangle law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and (-**D2)**.  If vector D1 and vector (-D2) are two sides of a triangle, then the third side of this triangle (which starts at the tail of **D1,** goes to the tail of (-**D2)**, and then goes to the tip of (-**D2))** is the resultant (**R**) of adding **D1** and (-**D2)**. In this option, the direction of **R** is not correct.  It should go from the tail of the first vector (**D1**) to the tip of the second (-**D2**).

In this option, the direction of (-**D2)** is not correct.  The vector arrow on **D2** should be going in the opposite direction.
