# Question:

Given the angle $\theta ^\circ$ between the two vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}=(A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j})$ and $\overrightarrow{B}=(B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j})$, which of the following expressions can be used to calculate the projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ onto $\overrightarrow{B}$?  Select all that apply.

# Answer:

a. $|\overrightarrow{A}|\cdot \text{cos}(\theta ^\circ)$

b. $|\overrightarrow{B}|\cdot \text{cos}(\theta ^\circ)$

c. $|\overrightarrow{A}|\cdot \text{sin}(\theta ^\circ)$

d. $\frac{A_x\cdot B_x+A_y\cdot B_y}{|\overrightarrow{B}|}$

# Feedback:

### Answer specific:

a. Good job!  This is one of the correct answers.  The solution to this question is provided below. 

b. This expression is for calculating the projection of $\overrightarrow{B}$ onto $\overrightarrow{A}.$ The solution to this question is provided below. 

c. See the figure below.  To calculate the projection of one vector onto another, you should use the magnitude of the first vector times the **cosine** of the angle. The solution to this question is provided below.

d. Good job! This is one of the correct answers.  The solution to this question is provided below. 

### General solution:

The dot product of two vectors is based on the projection of one vector onto another. It can be calculated in two ways.

$$\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}=|\overrightarrow{A}||\overrightarrow{B}|\text{cos}(\theta ^\circ)=A_x\cdot B_x+A_y \cdot B_y$$

The projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ onto $\overrightarrow{B}$ is given by $|\overrightarrow{A}|\text{cos}(\theta ^\circ)$. However, if the vectors' components are given and the angle between these two vectors is unknown, based on the equation above, one can move the magnitude of vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ to the other side and get:

$$|\overrightarrow{A}|\text{cos}(\theta ^\circ)=\frac{A_x\cdot B_x+A_y \cdot B_y}{|\overrightarrow{B}|}$$
