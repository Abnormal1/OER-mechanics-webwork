# Question:

Consider a three-dimensional vector with magnitude $r=[A]$ N, transverse angle $\theta=[B]\degree$, and azmuth angle $\phi=[C]\degree$. Find the $x$, $y$, and $z$ components of the vector so it can be expressed in the Cartesian form:

$$\overrightarrow{v}=\left(\_\_\hat{i}+\_\_\hat{j}+\_\_\hat{k}\right) \mathrm{N}$$

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (1, 10), 0 decimal places

$[B]:$ Range (90, 179), 0 decimal places

$[C]:$ Range (1, 89), 0 decimal places

# Answer:

$$x=[A]\cos[B]\sin[C]$$

$$y=[A]\sin[B]\sin[C]$$

$$z=[A]\cos[C]$$

# Feedback:

The angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ are spherical coordinate angles, that tell us which way the vector is pointing in the figure below:

Note that the **transverse angle**, $\theta$, is measured counter-clockwise (CCW) from the positive $x$ axis, as shown above, and can have a range of 0째 to 360째 (i.e. all the way around to the positive $x$ axis again). 

The **azimuthal angle**, $\phi$, is measured downward from the positive $z$ axis, and only has a range of 0째 to 180째 (i.e. down to the negative $z$ axis). 

In order to find each component, apply the following formulae:

$$A_x=|\bold{A}|\cos\theta\sin\phi$$

$$A_y=|\bold{A}|\sin\theta\sin\phi$$

$$A_z=|\bold{A}|\cos\phi$$
