# Question:

Consider the following two-dimensional vectors represented in terms of their magnitudes and directions (all angles are measured CCW from the positive $x$ axis): 

$$|\overrightarrow{v_1}|=[A],\quad\theta_1=[B]\degree$$

$$|\overrightarrow{v_2}|=[C],\quad\theta_2=[D]\degree$$

Calculate the **dot product** of the two vectors, $\overrightarrow{v_1}\cdot\overrightarrow{v_2}$.

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (1, 10), 0 decimal places

$[B]:$ Range (270, 359), 0 decimal places

$[C]:$ Range (1, 10), 0 decimal places

$[D]:$ Range (1, 89), 0 decimal places

# Answer:

$$\overrightarrow{v_1}\cdot\overrightarrow{v_2}=[A][C]\cos({[B]-[D]})$$

# Feedback:

To calculate the **dot product** using the magnitudes and directions of two vectors, you must multiply the magnitudes together and the cosine of the angle **between the vectors**. 

For example, consider two vectors with magnitudes $|\overrightarrow{v_1}|$ and $|\overrightarrow{v_2}|$ and directions $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. The angle between the vectors is found by subtracting the smaller angle from the larger, so that $\theta_3=\theta_2-\theta_1$. Then, the values can be entered into the dot product formula:

$$\overrightarrow{v_1}\cdot\overrightarrow{v_2}=|\overrightarrow{v_1}||\overrightarrow{v_2}|\cos({\theta_2-\theta_1})$$

Notice that the result of a dot product between two vectors is a **scalar**!
