# Answer:

a) $10\hat{i}+10\hat{j}$

b) $5\hat{i}+5\hat{j}$

c) $-5\hat{i}+5\hat{j}$

d) $-5\hat{i}-5\hat{j}$

# Feedback:

a) In two-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has two vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; and the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis. A vector in two-dimensional space is the vector sum of its two vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}$$

In this answer, the component magnitudes are incorrect.  To determine the component magnitudes, take a projection of the tip of the vector down onto the x-axis for the x-component magnitude.  That would be 5 in this case.  Likewise, for the y-component magnitude, take a projection over to the y-axis, which would also be 5 in this case.   

b) Good job! In two-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has two vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; and the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis. A vector in two-dimensional space is the vector sum of its two vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}$$

c) In two-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has two vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; and the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis. A vector in two-dimensional space is the vector sum of its two vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}$$

In this question, the vector is going in the positive x- and positive y-direction. So both its x- and y-component should be positive.   

d) In two-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has two vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$along the *y-*axis. A vector in two-dimensional space is the vector sum of its two vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}$$

In this question, the vector is going in the positive x- and positive y-direction. So both its x- and y-component should be positive.
