# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

A ring (point $A$) is suspended in mid-air by a spring and two ropes.  The spring is attached to a vertical wall on the left at point $C$ and one rope is attached to a vertical wall on the right at point $B$. The spring $AC$ is horizontal and has a spring constant of $k_{AC}=20\;\mathrm{N/m}$. The rope $AB$ is attached to the wall such that it has an angle of $\theta_{AB}=60\degree$, measured CCW from the positive $x$ axis.  The second rope pulls on the ring with a force of $F=600\;\mathrm{N}$ at an angle of $\theta_F=45\degree$, measured CW from the positive $x$ axis.  If rope $AB$ has a length of $0.5\;\mathrm{m}$ and the stretched length of spring $AC$ is $0.75\;\mathrm{m}$, what is the unstretched length of the spring?

From the list below, select **the correct option** depicting the information that you need to **find** in the above problem.  

a) the stretched length of the spring $AC$

b) the unstretched length of the spring $AC$

c) the tension on spring $AC$

d) the resultant force, $\overrightarrow{F_R}$

# Answer:

b) the unstretched length of the spring $AC$

# Feedback:

a) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** to solve the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement asks for the **unstretched** length of the spring - the stretched length is already given.

b) Good job! This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** to solve the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement directly asks for you to find "the unstretched length of the spring", which we also know is spring $AC$.

c) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** to solve the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does not ask for you to find the tension - in fact, it asks you to find out something about the spring **without** any tension on it. 

d) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** to solve the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. There is nothing in the problem statement about a resultant force, so you do not need to find this.
