# Automatic Feedback:

a. One can use the triangle law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**.  If vector D1 and vector D2 are two sides of a triangle, then the third side of this triangle (which starts at the tail of **D1,** and then goes to the tip of **D2)** is the resultant (**R**) of adding **D1** and **D2**. In this answer, the triangle law is not used to add **D1** and **D2.** If this explanation doesn’t help, please go to <a location where all the links are> for further assistance and then try this quiz again when you feel ready to do so.

b. Correct. One can use the triangle law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**.  If vector D1 and vector D2 are two sides of a triangle, then the third side of this triangle (which starts at the tail of **D1,** and then goes to the tip of **D2)** is the resultant (**R**) of adding **D1** and **D2**.

c. One can use the triangle law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**.  If vector D1 and vector D2 are two sides of a triangle, then the third side of this triangle (which starts at the tail of **D1,** goes to the tail of **D2**, and then goes to the tip of **D2)** is the resultant (**R**)of adding **D1** and **D2**.  In this answer, the direction of **R** is not correct.  It should go from the tail of the first vector (**D1**) to the tip of the second (**D2**).
