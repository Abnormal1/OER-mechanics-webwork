# Question:

Consider vectors **A** and **B** in the diagram below: 

![STATICS-ASV09%2001%2001%20a4e69f51f5b447219f9853eee210f1a2/Untitled.png](STATICS-ASV09%2001%2001%20a4e69f51f5b447219f9853eee210f1a2/Untitled.png)

Find the resultant vector **C** as a difference of vectors **A** and **B.** Fill in the blanks below to express the vector in the Cartesian form: 

$$\bold{C}=\bold{A}-\bold{B}=\_\_\hat{i}+\_\_\hat{j}$$

# Answer:

$$C_x=3; \qquad C_y=-1$$

# Feedback:

The subtraction of two vectors involves subtracting the $x$ components and $y$ components of each vector respectively. We must first determine the $x$ and $y$ components of each vector $\bold{A}$ and $\bold{B}$ from the graph, then find the difference between their components to get the resultant vector $\bold{C}$. 

$$\bold{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}$$

$$\bold{B}=B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}$$

$$\bold{C}=\bold{A}-\bold{B}=\left(A_x-B_x\right)\hat{i}+\left(A_y-B_y\right)\hat{j}$$
