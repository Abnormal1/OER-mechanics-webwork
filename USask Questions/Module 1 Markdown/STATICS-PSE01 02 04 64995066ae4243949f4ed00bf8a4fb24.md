# Feedback:

a. The sum of the forces in the y-direction is 2 N acting upwards. Thus, the particle described in this FBD is NOT in equilibrium.  

b. Good job! The sum of the forces in the x- and y-direction are both zero, which means the particle is in equilibrium. 

c. Even though the forces have the same magnitude, they are directed along different axes. Thus the resultant force is not zero and and the particle described in this FBD is NOT in equilibrium.

d. The sum of the forces in the y-direction is zero, but the sum of the forces in the x-direction is 2 N to the left. Thus, the particle described in this FBD is NOT in equilibrium.
