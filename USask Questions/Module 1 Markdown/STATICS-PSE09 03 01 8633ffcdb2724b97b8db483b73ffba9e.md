# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The hook depicted in the image below has two ropes pulling on it. The first rope is pulling with a force $F_1=100\;\mathrm{N}$ and the second rope is pulling with a force $F_2=150\;\mathrm{N}$.  The angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are $15\degree$and $10\degree$respectively. What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes?

From the list below, select **the correct option** depicting the information that you need to **find** in the above problem.  

a) the magnitudes of the two tension forces, $F_1$ and $F_2$

b) the resultant force vector acting on the hook due to the two ropes

c) the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes

d) the angle between $F_1$ and the positive $x$ axis, $\theta_1$

# Answer:

c) the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes

# Feedback:

a) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are being asked to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement already gives the magnitudes for the forces $F_1$ and $F_2$ in the written description, although they aren't stated in the diagram.

b) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are being asked to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does not ask you to find any vectors, but it does ask for something about the resultant force. 

c) Good job! This question asks you to identify what it is that you are being asked to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. No notation is given in the question, so re-stating the sentence describing "the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes" is the correct answer. 

d) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are being asked to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does give the value for the angle $\theta_1$ in the written description, although it isn't stated in the diagram.
