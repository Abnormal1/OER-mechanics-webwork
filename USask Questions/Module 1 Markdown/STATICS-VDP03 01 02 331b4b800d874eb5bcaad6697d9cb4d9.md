# Answer:

a. positive

b. 0

c. negative

### Answer specific:

a. The dot product of two vectors would be positive if the angle between them is acute $(\theta<90^\circ)$. The solution to this question is provided below. 

b. Well done! The dot product of two vectors would be 0 if the two vectors are perpendicular to each other.  The solution to this question is provided below. 

c. The dot product of two vectors would be negative if the angle between them is obtuse $(90^\circ\lt\theta<180^\circ)$. The solution to this question is provided below. 

### General solution:

The dot product of two vectors is based on the projection of one vector onto another. it is defined by the equation:

$$⁍$$

Thus, the dot product would be positive if the two vectors are pointing in similar directions $(\theta<90^\circ)$ , zero if they are perpendicular, and negative if the two vectors are pointing in nearly opposite directions $(90^\circ\lt\theta<180^\circ)$. In this question, the given vectors are perpendicular to each other, so their dot product should be 0.
