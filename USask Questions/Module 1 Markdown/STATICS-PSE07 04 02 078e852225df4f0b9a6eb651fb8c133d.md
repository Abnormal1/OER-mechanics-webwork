# Feedback:

a. The structure AE can be considered to be a strut. In this answer, the force provided by the strut is missing.  Struts are generally used to resist compression, but sometimes they may serve in tension. In this case, all of the forces provided by the cables are tensile forces pulling downwards.  Thus, the strut must be in compression and must provide a force directed upwards. 

b. First, remember cables can only provide tension, and tension can only pull on an object. Then, the structure AE can be considered to be a strut. Struts are generally used to resist compression, but sometimes they may serve in tension.  In this case, all of the forces provided by the cables are tensile forces pulling downwards.  Thus, the strut must be in compression and must provide a force directed upwards. 

c. Good job! This is the correct FBD for point A.

d. The structure AE can be considered to be a strut. Struts are generally used to resist compression, but sometimes they may serve in tension.
