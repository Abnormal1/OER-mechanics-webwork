# Question:

Which unit vector in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system points along the positive $x$ axis?

# Answer:

a) $\hat{i}$

b) $\hat{j}$

d) $\hat{k}$

d) $\hat{r}$

# Feedback:

a) Correct! The unit vector $\hat{i}$ points along the positive $x$ axis.

b) The unit vector $\hat{j}$ points along the positive $y$ axis. The unit vector $\hat{i}$ points along the positive $x$ axis.

c) The unit vector $\hat{k}$ points along the positive $z$ axis. The unit vector $\hat{i}$ points along the positive $x$ axis.

d) The vector $\overrightarrow{r}$ usually denotes a position vector, whose direction is given by its unit vector $\hat{r}$. The unit vector $\hat{i}$ points along the positive $x$ axis.
