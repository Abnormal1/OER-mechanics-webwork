# Feedback:

a. The block is sitting on the spring. Therefore, the spring must be compressed, and the force, $\overrightarrow{F_S}$, should be acting upwards. 

b. Good job, this is the correct FBD for the block.

c. The weight of the block is supported by the compressed spring, not by the ground reaction force,  $\overrightarrow{F_N}$. 

d. First of all, the weight of the block should be acting downwards. Then the weight of the block is supported by the compressed spring. Thus, the force, $\overrightarrow{F_S}$, should be acting upwards. Lastly, this block is not in contact with any surface, so there should not be any ground reaction force,  $\overrightarrow{F_N}$.
