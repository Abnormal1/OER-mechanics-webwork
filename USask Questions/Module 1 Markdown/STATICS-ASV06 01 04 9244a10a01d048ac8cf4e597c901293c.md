# Answer:

$5\hat{i}+10\hat{j}$

# Feedback:

In two-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has two vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; and the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$ along the *y-*axis. A vector in two-dimensional space is the vector sum of its two vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}$$
