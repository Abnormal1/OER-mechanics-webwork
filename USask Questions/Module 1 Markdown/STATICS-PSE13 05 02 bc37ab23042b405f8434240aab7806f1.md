# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The hook depicted in the image below has two ropes pulling on it. The first rope is pulling with a force $F_1=100\;\mathrm{N}$ and the second rope is pulling with a force $F_2=150\;\mathrm{N}$. The angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are $15\degree$ and $10\degree$ respectively.  What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes?

Assume that the correct numerical answer to the problem above is $212.55246$.  From the list below, select the best ****conclusion. 

a) The magnitude of the resultant force is $F_R=213\;\mathrm{N}$. 

b) The resultant force vector acting on the hook due to the two ropes is $F_R=213\;\mathrm{N}$. 

c) The magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes is $F_R=213\;\mathrm{N}$. 

d) Acting on the screw hook is $F_R=213\;\mathrm{N}$. 

# Answer:

c) The magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes is $F_R=213\;\mathrm{N}$. 

# Feedback:

a) The conclusion to a problem must provide a sentence that answers the original question.  While this answer isn't incorrect, there is a better answer that is more descriptive and specific.

b) The conclusion to a problem must provide a sentence that answers the original question.  This answer isn't totally correct - the problem statement asked for a magnitude, not a vector.

c) Good job! The conclusion to a problem must provide a sentence that answers the original question.  This one does, and it includes appropriately specific details. 

d) The conclusion to a problem must provide a sentence that answers the original question.  There is a better answer that provides more specific details with proper English grammar.
