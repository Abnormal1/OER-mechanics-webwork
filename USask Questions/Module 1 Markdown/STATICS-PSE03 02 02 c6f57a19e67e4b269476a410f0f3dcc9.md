# Question:

Given two forces acting on a particle at rest, $\overrightarrow{W}=(0\hat{i}-[A]\hat{j})~\text{N}$ and $\overrightarrow{F_1}=([B]\hat{i}+0\hat{j})~\text{N}$, is the particle in static equilibrium.

- [ ]  Yes
- [ ]  No

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (3, 11) in steps of 1

$[B]=[A]-1$ 

# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

We say that an object is in static equilibrium if it is originally at rest and remains at rest. This requires that all the forces acting on the object form a zero resultant force. In this question, 

$$\overrightarrow{W}+\overrightarrow{F_1}=((0\hat{i}-[A]\hat{j})~\text{N}+([B]\hat{i}+0\hat{j})~\text{N}=([B]\hat{i}-[A]\hat{j})~\text{N}$$

Therefore, the particle is NOT in static equilibrium.
