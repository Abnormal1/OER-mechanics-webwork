# Answer:

a) One, $x$

b) One, $y$

c) Zero, $x$

d) Infinity, $z$

# Feedback:

a) Correct! The unit vector $\hat{i}$ has length **ONE** and is directed along the positive $**x**$ axis.

b) That is the correct **length** for the unit vector $\hat{i}$ but it is directed along the positive $**x**$ axis.

c) That is the correct **direction** for the unit vector $\hat{i}$ but it has a length of **one**. 

d) A unit vector has a length of **one** and the unit vector $\hat{i}$ is directed along the positive $**x**$ axis.
