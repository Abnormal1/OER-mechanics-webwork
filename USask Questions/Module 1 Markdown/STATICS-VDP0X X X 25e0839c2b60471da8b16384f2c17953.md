# Question:

Knowing the dot product of two vectors is [C], and their magnitudes are [A] and [B], respectively. What is the angle between these two vectors? Round your answer to 3 significant figures.

Enter your answer: ____$^\circ$

### Variable Parameters

$[C]:$ Range (-20, 20) in steps of 1

$[A]:$ Range (5, 9) in steps of 2

$[B]:$ Range (4, 8) in steps of 2

# Answer:

$$\text{cos}^{-1}(\frac{[C]}{[A]\cdot [B]})$$

# Feedback:

The dot product of two vectors is given by:

$$‚Åç$$

Therefore, knowing the dot product of the two vectors and their magnitudes, we can calculate the angle between these two vectors:

$$\theta=\text{cos}^{-1}(\frac{\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}}{|\overrightarrow{A}||\overrightarrow{B}|})$$
