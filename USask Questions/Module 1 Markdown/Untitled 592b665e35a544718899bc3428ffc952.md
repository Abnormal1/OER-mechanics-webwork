# Question:

Given the following **vector** equation of 3D particle equilibrium:

$$\sum F_z=0$$

Choose from the list below as to what should be fixed so that the above statement is correct. 

a) The subscript, $z$, should be removed from ${F}_z$

b) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be added to ${F}_z$

c) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be added to ${F}_z$, and the subscript $z$ should be removed

d) Nothing needs to be fixed on the equation

# Answer:

c) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be added to ${F}_z$, and the subscript $z$ should be removed

# Feedback:

a) While this is true, there is something else that needs to be done to get the fully correct form of the equation.

b) While this is true, there is something else that needs to be done to get the fully correct form of the equation.

c) Correct! The correct vector equation should be the summation of the force vectors $\overrightarrow{F}$, each of which includes its $x$, $y$, and $z$ components. 

d) The stated equation is not correct. It should be in vector notation, and should not specify just the z components.
