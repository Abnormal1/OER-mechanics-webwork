# Feedbackï¼š

### Answer specific feedback:

a. Well done! This is the correct FBD for the ball.

b. Knowing the ball is in static equilibrium, the spring force must be acting to the left in order to cancel out the horizontal component of the reaction force. 

c. The reaction force should be perpendicular to to the inclined surface. See the feedback below for how to find the direction of the reaction force. 

d. The reaction force should be perpendicular to to the inclined surface. See the feedback below for how to find the direction of the reaction force. Also, knowing the ball is in static equilibrium, the spring force must be acting to the left in order to cancel out the horizontal component of the reaction force. 

### General Feedback:

There are multiple ways to figure out the angle between the reaction force and the horizontal axis. See the figure below:

One way is to use the Triangle Sum theorem which states the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$. Therefore, from the right triangle ACD, you can calculate that angle D equals to $60^\circ$. Then in the right triangle BCD, you can calculate angle C equals to  $30^\circ$.

An alternative way is to use similar triangles. By observing triangle ACD and triangle BCD, one can quickly draw a conclusion that these two are similar triangles, because they have two equal angles: angle D and a right angle.  Thus, the third angles in these two triangles must equal to each other as well. This means angle C equals to angle A, which is $30^\circ.$
