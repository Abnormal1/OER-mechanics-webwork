# Question:

What is the length of the unit vector $\hat{k}$?

# Answer:

a) 0.1

b) 1

c) 10

d) Not enough information

# Feedback:

a) The unit vector $\hat{k}$ has the length of a **single unit**. 

b) Correct! The unit vector $\hat{k}$ has the length of a **single unit**, which is 1.

c) The unit vector $\hat{k}$ has the length of a **single unit**. 

d) Because $\hat{k}$ is a **unit vector**, we have enough information by its definition to know its length (the length of a **single unit**).
