# Automatic Feedback:

a. One can use the parallelogram law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. If vector D1 and vector D2 are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point of **D1** and **D2** is the resultant (vector R) of adding vectors D1 and D2. In this option, the direction of **D2** is not correct. The vector arrow on **D2** should be going in the opposite direction.

b. Correct. One can use the parallelogram law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. If vector D1 and vector D2 are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point of **D1** and **D2** is the resultant (vector R) of adding vectors D1 and D2.

c. One can use the parallelogram law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. If vector D1 and vector D2 are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point of **D1** and **D2** is the resultant (vector R) of adding vectors D1 and D2. In this answer, the parallelogram is not shown (although it is required by the problem statement).
