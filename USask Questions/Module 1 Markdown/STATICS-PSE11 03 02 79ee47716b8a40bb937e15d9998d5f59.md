# Question:

Given the following Cartesian vector expression of static equilibrium:

$$\sum\overrightarrow{F}_x\hat{i}+F_y\hat{j}=0$$

Choose from the list below as to what should be fixed so that the above statement is correct. 

a) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be removed from $\overrightarrow{F}_x$, 

b) The subscripts, $x$ and $y$, should be removed from both terms

c) The equation should be split into two equations, one for each component

d) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be removed from $\overrightarrow{F}_x$, and the summation sign, $\Sigma$, is needed in front of the second term, $F_y\hat{j}$

# Answer:

d) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be removed from $\overrightarrow{F}_x$, and the summation sign, $\Sigma$, is needed in front of the second term, $F_y\hat{j}$

# Feedback:

a) While this is true, it's not the only thing that needs to be fixed so that the equation is correct. 

b) Although we do have the unit vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$, we still need subscripts $x$ and $y$ to keep the scalar components differentiated. 

c) While this is true for scalar notation, when the equilibrium equation is written in Cartesian vector notation, the two terms can be combined. 

d) Correct!  For Cartesian vector notation, we need an $\hat{i}$ and a $\hat{j}$ term.  They should both be sums of all their respective components, and each component will be of the form $F_x\hat{i}$ or $F_y\hat{j}$.
