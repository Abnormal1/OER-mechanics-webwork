# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

A hook screwed into a wall has two ropes pulling on it. The first rope is pulling with a force $F_1=100\;\mathrm{N}$ at an angle $\theta_1=15\degree$. The second rope is pulling with a force $F_2=150\;\mathrm{N}$ at an angle $\theta_2=80\degree$. What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes? Both angles $\theta_1$  and $\theta_2$ are measured CCW from the positive $x$ axis.

---

From the list below, select **all the correct options** depicting the information that is **given** in the above problem.  

a) Hook being pulled on by two ropes

b) Dimensions as shown

c) $F_1=100\;\mathrm{N}$

d) $F_1=100$

e) $\theta_1=15\degree$

f) $\theta_1=15\degree$, measured CCW from the positive $x$ axis

g) $F=150\;\mathrm{N}$

h) $F_2=150\;\mathrm{N}$

i) $\theta_2=80\degree$, measured CCW from the positive $x$ axis

j) $\theta_2=80$, measured CCW from the positive $x$ axis

k) Coordinate axes as shown

# Answer:

a) Hook being pulled on by two ropes

c) $F_1=100\;\mathrm{N}$

f) $\theta_1=15\degree$, measured CCW from the positive $x$ axis

h) $F_2=150\;\mathrm{N}$

i) $\theta_2=80\degree$, measured CCW from the positive $x$ axis

# Feedback:

Every piece of work submitted in engineering practice should be self-contained and effective in presenting the problem addressed and the analysis method used. For each problem in this course, your submitted work should be divided into five parts, each with its own clearly marked heading:

- Given
- Find
- Assumptions
- Analysis
- Conclusions

This question asks you to identify the correct information required in the **Given** section of your submission. This section must provide a clear text summary of the information provided in the problem statement and diagram (if any). This does not mean copying verbatim from the problem statement. All pertinent information and data must be extracted from the problem statement and listed. And there is no need to recopy complex diagrams provided with the problem statement, although additional annotations on the diagram may be appropriate.

The **Given** section is presented as a bulleted list. The bullet points will be of four general types:

- providing a brief description of the scenario being analyzed
- directing the reader to illustrations with key information
- listing variables and their values
- noting coordinate systems, if any are provided

**Common Errors** include:

- Simply stating "see figure" - more information should be stated, like "see figure for dimensions"
- Missing key information - a force, angle, mass, or other piece of information given in the problem statement
- Mis-stating key information - missing the units, stating incorrect unit, stating an incorrect value, etc.
- Mis-stating variable symbols - missing a subscript notation, using a capital letter instead of a lower case, using the wrong letter, etc.
- Mixing scalars and vectors - writing a vector as a scalar or vice versa is a different form of mis-stating information and misrepresents key values in the problem

In this problem, no dimensions are shown, forces need subscripts and units, so do angles, and angles need reference axes.  Also, no coordinate axes are shown.
