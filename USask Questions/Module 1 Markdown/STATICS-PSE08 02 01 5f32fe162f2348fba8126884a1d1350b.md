# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The hook depicted in the image below has two ropes pulling on it. What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the screw hook due to the two ropes?

From the list below, select **all the correct options** depicting the information that is **given** in the above problem.  

a) Hook supporting by two ropes

b) Angles as shown

c) See figure

d) $\overrightarrow{F_1}=100\;\mathrm{N}$

e) $F_1=100\;\mathrm{N}$

f) $F_2=150\;\mathrm{N}$

g) $f_2=150\;\mathrm{N}$

h) Coordinate axes as shown

# Answer:

a) Hook supporting by two ropes

b) Angles as shown

e) $F_1=100\;\mathrm{N}$

f) $F_2=150\;\mathrm{N}$

h) Coordinate axes as shown

# Feedback:

Every piece of work submitted in engineering practice should be self-contained and effective in presenting the problem addressed and the analysis method used. For each problem in this course, your submitted work should be divided into five parts, each with its own clearly marked heading:

- Given
- Find
- Assumptions
- Analysis
- Conclusions

This question asks you to identify the correct information required in the **Given** section of your submission. This section must provide a clear text summary of the information provided in the problem statement and diagram (if any). This does not mean copying verbatim from the problem statement. All pertinent information and data must be extracted from the problem statement and listed. And there is no need to recopy complex diagrams provided with the problem statement, although additional annotations on the diagram may be appropriate.

The **Given** section is presented as a bulleted list. The bullet points will be of four general types:

- providing a brief description of the scenario being analyzed
- directing the reader to illustrations with key information
- listing variables and their values
- noting coordinate systems, if any are provided

**Common Errors** include:

- Simply stating "see figure" - more information should be stated, like "see figure for dimensions"
- Missing key information - a force, angle, mass, or other piece of information given in the problem statement
- Mis-stating key information - missing the units, stating incorrect unit, stating an incorrect value, etc.
- Mis-stating variable symbols - missing a subscript notation, using a capital letter instead of a lower case, using the wrong letter, etc.
- Mixing scalars and vectors - writing a vector as a scalar or vice versa is a different form of mis-stating information and misrepresents key values in the problem

In this problem, you can't give a vector without a direction, vector names should be capitalized, and you can't just say "see figure".  You should tell the reader what they should be looking for on the figure e.g. "see figure for angles and force magnitudes".
