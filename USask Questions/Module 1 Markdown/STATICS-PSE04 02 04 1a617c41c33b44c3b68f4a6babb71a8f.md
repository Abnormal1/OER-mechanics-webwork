# Question:

The following forces are acting on a particle at rest:

$\overrightarrow{F_1}=(0\hat{i}+[A]\hat{j}+0\hat{k})~ \text{N}$

$\overrightarrow{F_2}=(0\hat{i}+0\hat{j}-[A]\hat{k})~\text{N}$,

$\overrightarrow{F_3}=(0\hat{i}+0\hat{j}+[A]\hat{k})~\text{N}$

Is the particle in static equilibrium?

- [ ]  Yes
- [ ]  No

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (3, 11) in steps of 1

# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

We say that an object is in static equilibrium if it is originally at rest and remains at rest. This requires that all the forces acting on the object form a zero resultant force. In this question, 

$$\overrightarrow{F_1}+\overrightarrow{F_2}+\overrightarrow{F_3}=(0\hat{i}+[A]\hat{j}+0\hat{k})~\text{N}+(0\hat{i}+0\hat{j}-[A]\hat{k})~\text{N}+(0\hat{i}+0\hat{j}+[A]\hat{k})~\text{N}=(0\hat{i}+[A]\hat{j}+0\hat{k})~\text{N}$$

Therefore, the particle is NOT in static equilibrium.
