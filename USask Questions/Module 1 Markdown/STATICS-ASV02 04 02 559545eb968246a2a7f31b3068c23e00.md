# Automatic Feedback:

a. One can use the parallelogram law to subtract one vector from another, such as **D1** and **D2**. **D1**-**D2**=**D1**+(-**D2**). (-**D2)** has the same magnitude as **D2** but in the opposite direction. If vector D1 and vector (-D2) are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point as **D1** and (-**D2)** is the resultant of adding vectors D1 and (-D2). In this answer, the parallelogram rule is not used to add **D1** and (-**D2**)**.** If this explanation doesn’t help, please go to <a location where all the links are> for further assistance and then try this quiz again when you feel ready to do so. 

b. Correct. One can use the parallelogram law to subtract one vector from another, such as **D1** and **D2**. **D1**-**D2**=**D1**+(-**D2**). (-**D2)** has the same magnitude as **D2** but in the opposite direction. If vector D1 and vector (-D2) are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point as **D1** and (-**D2)** is the resultant of adding vectors D1 and (-D2).

c. One can use the parallelogram law to subtract one vector from another, such as **D1** and **D2**. **D1**-**D2**=**D1**+(-**D2**).

If vector D1 and vector (-D2) are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point as **D1** and (-**D2)** is the resultant of adding vectors D1 and (-D2).  In this answer, the direction of (-**D2)** is not correct.  The vector arrow on (-**D2)** should be going in the opposite direction.
