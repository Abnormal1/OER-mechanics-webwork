# Question:

For a vector with a magnitude of $[A]$ N directed along the positive $y$-axis, determine the $x$ and $y$ components to express the vector in Cartesian form:

$$\overrightarrow{v}=\left(\_\_\hat{i}+\_\_\hat{j}\right) \mathrm{N}$$

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (1, 20), 0 decimal places

# Answer:

$$x=0$$

$$y=[A]$$

# Feedback:

This vector is pointing along the positive $y$-axis, thus, the angle between this vector and the positive $x$-axis is 90 degrees.

To find the $x$ component from the magnitude and angle of a vector, multiply the magnitude by the cosine of the angle.

To find the $y$ component from the magnitude and angle of a vector, multiply the magnitude by the sine of the angle.
