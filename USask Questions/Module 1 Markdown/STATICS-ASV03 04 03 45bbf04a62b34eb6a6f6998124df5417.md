# Automatic Feedback:

a. One can use the triangle law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**.  If vector D1 and vector D2 are two sides of a triangle, then the third side of this triangle (which starts at the tail of **D1,** goes to the tail of **D2**, and then goes to the tip of **D2)** is the resultant (**R**) of adding **D1** and **D2**.  In this option, the direction of **D2** is not correct.  The vector arrow on **D2** should be going in the opposite direction.

In this option, the direction of **R** is not correct.  It should go from the tail of the first vector (**D1**) to the tip of the second (**D2**).
