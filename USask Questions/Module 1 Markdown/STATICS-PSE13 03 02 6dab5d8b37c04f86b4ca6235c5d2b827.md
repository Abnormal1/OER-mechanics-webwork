# Question:

Given the following Cartesian vector equation of equilibrium:

$$\sum{F}_x\hat{i}+\sum F_y{j}+\sum {f_z}\hat{k}=0$$

Choose from the list below as to what should be fixed so that the above statement is correct. 

a) The unit vector $\hat{j}$ is missing its hat, and the term $f_z$ should be capitalized

b) The force terms, $F_x$, $F_y$, and $f_z$ are missing their vector symbols, $\overrightarrow{}$, and the unit vector $\hat{j}$ is missing its hat 

c) The subscripts, $x$, $y$, and $z$, should be removed from all the terms

d) The equation should be split into three, one for each component

# Answer:

a) The unit vector $\hat{j}$ is missing its hat, and the term $f_z$ should be capitalized

# Feedback:

a) Correct!  The sum of all scalar force components in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions can be combined when using unit vector Cartesian notation. 

b) The force terms do not need vector symbols when represented in Cartesian vector notation with unit vectors, although the unit vector $\hat{j}$ is missing its hat!

c) The subscripts are necessary to differentiate the scalar force components, along with their respective unit vectors. 

d) This equation can be split into three, one for each component direction (as long as the vector $\hat{j}$  is given its hat, and $f_z$ is capitalized).  However, the question asked for the Cartesian vector equation (singular), not equations (plural).
