# Automatic Feedback:

a. One can use the triangle law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and (-**D2)**.  If vector D1 and vector (-D2) are two sides of a triangle, then the third side of this triangle (which starts at the tail of **D1,** goes to the tail of (-**D2)**, and then goes to the tip of (-**D2))** is the resultant (**R**) of adding **D1** and (-**D2)**. In this option, the direction of (-**D2)** is not correct.  The vector arrow on (-**D2)** should be going in the opposite direction.

b. One can use the triangle law to add two vectors, such as **D1** and (-**D2)**.  If vector D1 and vector (-D2) are two sides of a triangle, then the third side of this triangle (which starts at the tail of **D1,** goes to the tail of (-**D2)**, and then goes to the tip of (-**D2))** is the resultant (**R**) of adding **D1** and (-**D2)**. In this answer, the triangle law is not used to add **D1** and (-**D2)**.
