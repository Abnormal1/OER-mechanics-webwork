# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

If a downward force of $450\;\mathrm{lb}$ is applied to point $A$ in the strut system shown below, what is the force directed along $A$$B$?

From the list below, select **the correct option** depicting the information that you need to **find** in the above problem.  

a) the force directed along $A$$B$

b) the angle between the struts

c) the force directed along $B$$A$

d) the resultant force, $\overrightarrow{F}$

# Answer:

a) the force directed along $A$$B$

# Feedback:

a) Good job!  This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** for this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. No notation is given in the question, so re-stating the sentence describing "the force directed along $A$$B$" is the correct answer. 

b) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** for this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does not ask you to find an angle, and in fact, the angle between the struts is already given in the diagram.  

c) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** for this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. Look carefully at which direction the force is to be directed.

d) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** for this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does not ask for you to find a resultant vector, and there is no $\overrightarrow{F}$ labeled on the diagram.
