# Question:

What is the length of the unit vector $\hat{j}$?

# Answer:

a) Not enough information

b) 0.1

c) 1

d) 10

# Feedback:

a) Because $\hat{j}$ is a **unit vector**, we have enough information by its definition to know its length (the length of a **single unit**). 

b) The unit vector $\hat{j}$ has the length of a **single unit**. 

c) Correct! The unit vector $\hat{j}$ has the length of a **single unit**, which is 1.

d) The unit vector $\hat{j}$ has the length of a **single unit**.
