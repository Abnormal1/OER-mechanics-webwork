# Question:

From the options below, select the correct set of equations that govern 3D particle static equilibrium, in terms of **scalar** notation.

a) $\sum{F}_x+\sum{F}_y+\sum{F}_z=0$

b) $\sum\overrightarrow{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum\overrightarrow{F}_y=0,\;\; \sum\overrightarrow{F}_z=0$

c) $\sum{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum{F}_y=0, \;\;\sum{F}_z=0$

d) $\sum{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum{F}_y=0$

# Answer:

c) $\sum{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum{F}_y=0, \;\;\sum{F}_z=0$

# Feedback:

a) While this answer does provide the correct scalar notation, the sum of all the scalars in the three coordinate directions must equal zero **separately**, not combined.

b) While this answer provides the correct set-up of equations, the notation is not quite correct. The question asked for **scalar** notation, and these are written as vectors. 

c) Correct! The sum of all the scalar force components must equal zero in each direction.

d) This answer would be correct for a 2D problem, but this question involves 3D particle static equilibrium.
