# Question:

Given a) the magnitudes of two vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, which are $[A]$ and $[B]$ respectively, and b) the angle between them ($[C]^\circ$), what is the magnitude and direction of the projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ onto $\overrightarrow{B}$?

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (3, 11) in steps of 2

$[B]:$ Range (2, 10) in steps of 2

$[C]:$ Range (91, 179) in steps of 1

# Answer:

a. $||\overrightarrow{A}|\cdot \text{cos}([C] ^\circ)|,$ or $|[A]\cdot \text{cos}([C] ^\circ)|,$ along the direction opposite to $\overrightarrow{B}$.

b. $||\overrightarrow{A}|\cdot \text{cos}([C] ^\circ)|,$ or $|[A]\cdot \text{cos}([C] ^\circ)|,$ along the direction of $\overrightarrow{B}$.

c. $|\overrightarrow{A}|\cdot \text{cos}([C] ^\circ),$ or $[A]\cdot \text{cos}([C] ^\circ),$ along the direction opposite to $\overrightarrow{B}$.

d. $|\overrightarrow{B}|\cdot \text{cos}([C] ^\circ),$ or $[B]\cdot \text{cos}([C] ^\circ),$ along the direction opposite to $\overrightarrow{B}$.

# Feedback:

a. Good job. Since the angle between the two vectors is obtuse (>90 degrees), the projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ onto $\overrightarrow{B}$ should be in the direction opposite to $\overrightarrow{B}$.  Also, the magnitude of a projection should always be positive, so it should be equal to the absolute value of $|\overrightarrow{A}|\cdot \text{cos(}[C] ^\circ)$

b. Since the angle between the two vectors is obtuse (>90 degrees), the projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ onto $\overrightarrow{B}$ should be in the direction opposite to $\overrightarrow{B}$.  Also, the magnitude of a projection should always be positive, so it should be equal to the absolute value of $|\overrightarrow{A}|\cdot \text{cos(}[C] ^\circ)$

c. Since the angle between the two vectors is obtuse (>90 degrees), the projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ onto $\overrightarrow{B}$ should be in the direction opposite to $\overrightarrow{B}$.  Also, the magnitude of a projection should always be positive, so it should be equal to the absolute value of $|\overrightarrow{A}|\cdot \text{cos(}[C] ^\circ)$

d. Since the angle between the two vectors is obtuse (>90 degrees), the projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ onto $\overrightarrow{B}$ should be in the direction opposite to $\overrightarrow{B}$.  Also, the question asked for the projection of $\overrightarrow{A}$ onto $\overrightarrow{B}$, so we need to use the magnitude of $\overrightarrow{A}$, not $\overrightarrow{B}$.  As well, the magnitude of a projection should always be positive, so it should be equal to the absolute value of $|\overrightarrow{A}|\cdot \text{cos(}[C] ^\circ)$
