# Feedback:

a. The sum of the forces in the x-direction is 2 N to the right, and the sum of the forces in the y-direction is 2 N acting downwards. Thus, the particle described in this FBD is NOT in equilibrium.

b. Good job!  The sum of the forces in the x- and y-direction are both zero, which means the particle is in equilibrium. 

c. The sum of the forces in the x-direction is zero, but the sum of the forces in the y-direction is 2 N acting upwards. Thus, the particle described in this FBD is NOT in equilibrium.

d. The sum of the forces in the y-direction is zero, but the sum of the forces in the x-direction is 2 N to the left. Thus, the particle described in this FBD is NOT in equilibrium.
