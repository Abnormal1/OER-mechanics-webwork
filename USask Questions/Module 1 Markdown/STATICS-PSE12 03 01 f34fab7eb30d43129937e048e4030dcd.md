# Question:

From the options below, select the correct equation that represents 3D particle static equilibrium, in **Cartesian vector notation**.

a) $\sum{F}_x+{F}_y+F_z=0$

b) $\sum F_x\hat{i}+\sum F_y\hat{j}+\sum F_z\hat{k}=0$

c) $\sum{F}_x=0,\;\;\sum{F}_y=0,\;\;\sum{F}_z=0$

d) $\sum F_x\hat{i}+\sum F_y\hat{j}=0$

# Answer:

b) $\sum F_x\hat{i}+\sum F_y\hat{j}+\sum F_z\hat{k}=0$

# Feedback:

a) This answer is close, but it is missing the unit vectors and the proper summation signs.

b) Correct!  The sums of scalar force components must be multiplied by their respective unit vectors for proper Cartesian vector notation. 

c) This answer is correct for scalar representation of the equilibrium equations, but not for Cartesian vector notation.

d) This answer is correct for a 2D situation, but is missing the third dimension.
