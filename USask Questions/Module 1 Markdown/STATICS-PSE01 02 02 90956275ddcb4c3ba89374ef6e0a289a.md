# Feedback:

a. The two forces acting on the particle are directed along different axes. Thus the resultant force is not zero and and the particle described in this FBD is NOT in equilibrium.  

b. The sum of the forces in the y-direction is 2 N acting upwards, which means the particle is NOT in equilibrium. 

c. Well done! The two forces acting on this particle are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Thus, the particle described in this FBD is in equilibrium.

d. Even though the forces have the same magnitude, they are directed along different axes. Thus the resultant force is not zero and and the particle described in this FBD is NOT in equilibrium.
