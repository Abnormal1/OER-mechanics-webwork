# Question:

From the options below, select the correct equation that governs 3D particle static equilibrium, in terms of **vector** notation.

a) $\sum\overrightarrow{F}_x+\overrightarrow{F}_y+\overrightarrow{F}_z=0$

b) $\sum\overrightarrow{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum\overrightarrow{F}_y=0,\;\; \sum\overrightarrow{F}_z=0$

c) $\sum\overrightarrow{F}=0$

d) $\overrightarrow{F}=0$

# Answer:

c) $\sum\overrightarrow{F}=0$

# Feedback:

a) While this answer does provide the correct vector notation, this answer is not a correct equation for static equilibrium as it lacks the summation symbols before the y and z terms.

b) These are correct vector equations (plural) for static equilibrium.  However, the question asked for the correct equation (singular). 

c) Correct!  The sum of all the force vectors in the problem must add to zero in order to have static equilibrium, and this notation is the same for 2D and 3D problems.

d) This answer is missing the $\Sigma$ symbol, which denotes summation of all the force vectors.
