# Answer:

Yes

# Feedback:

The directions of the forces provided by the struts are a bit difficult to determine in this case. We know that struts can provide either longitudinal tension or compression. Since the cable is pulling downwards, the struts are likely in tension, but it is not necessary for all three struts to be in tension. In fact, you can simply assume all of the struts are in tension for the FBD. Then, if your assumption is incorrect, you would just get a negative number as a result. 

However, if you want to draw a more accurate FBD, it might help you figuring out the direction of the force in a member by taking it out of the system. For example, see the top view of this system below, if strut OA doesn't exist, point O would fall away from point A. So strut OA should have provided a force preventing it from falling away, thus, struct OA must be in tension. However, if you take strut OB out of the system, point O would fall towards point B, which proves strut OB is actually in compression.
