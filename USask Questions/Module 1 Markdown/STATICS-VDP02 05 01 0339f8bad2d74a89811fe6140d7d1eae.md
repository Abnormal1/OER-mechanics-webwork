# Question:

For a 3D vector with a magnitude of $[A]$ and a coordinate direction angle $\alpha=[B]^\circ$, which one of the following expressions calculates the magnitude of the projection of this vector onto the positive x-axis?

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (3, 10) in steps of 1

$[B]:$ Range (1, 90) in steps of 1

# Answer:

a. $[A]$

b. $[B]$

c.  $[A]\cos([B]^\circ)$

d.  $[A]\cos(90^\circ-[B]^\circ)$

# Feedback:

a. This is just the magnitude of the vector. To calculate the projection of a vector onto an axis, use the magnitude of this vector times the cosine of the angle between the vector and the axis. For this question, recall that the coordinate direction angle $\alpha$ is the angle between the vector and the positive x-axis. 

b. This is the angle between the vector and the positive x-axis. To calculate the projection of a vector onto an axis, use the magnitude of this vector times the cosine of the angle between the vector and the axis. For this question, recall that the coordinate direction angle $\alpha$ is the angle between the vector and the positive x-axis. 

c. Good job! To calculate the projection of a vector onto an axis, use the magnitude of this vector times the cosine of the angle between the vector and the axis. For this question, recall that the coordinate direction angle $\alpha$ is the angle between the vector and the positive x-axis. 

d. To calculate the projection of a vector onto an axis, use the magnitude of this vector times the cosine of the angle between the vector and the axis.  For this question, recall that the coordinate direction angle $\alpha$ is the angle between the vector and the positive x-axis. $(90^\circ-\alpha)$ in this answer calculates the angle between the vector and the positive y-axis.
