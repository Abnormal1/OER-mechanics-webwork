b. 0

c. negative

# Feedback:

a. Good job! The dot product of two vectors is based on the projection of one vector onto another. it is defined by the equation:

$$⁍$$

Thus, the dot product would be positive if the two vectors are pointing in similar directions $(\theta<90^\circ)$ , zero if they are perpendicular, and negative if the two vectors are pointing in nearly opposite directions $(90^\circ\lt\theta<180^\circ)$. In this question, the two vectors are pointing along the same direction. Thus, the angle between these two vectors is 0, and their dot product is simply the multiplication of their magnitudes.
