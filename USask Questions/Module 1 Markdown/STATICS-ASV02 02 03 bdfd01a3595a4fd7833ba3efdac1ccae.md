# Automatic Feedback:

a. One can use the parallelogram law to subtract two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. **D1**-**D2**=**D1**+(-**D2**). (-**D2)** has the same magnitude as **D2** but in the opposite direction. If vector D1 and vector (-D2) are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point as **D1** and (-**D2)** is the resultant of adding vectors D1 and (-D2).  In this answer, the direction of (-**D2)** is not correct.  The vector arrow on (-**D2)** should be going in the opposite direction.

b. Correct. One can use the parallelogram law to subtract two vectors, such as **D1** and **D2**. **D1**-**D2**=**D1**+(-**D2**). (-**D2)** has the same magnitude as **D2** but in the opposite direction. If vector D1 and vector (-D2) are adjacent sides of a parallelogram, the diagonal of this parallelogram which starts at the same starting point as **D1** and (-**D2)** is the resultant of adding vectors D1 and (-D2).

In this answer, the direction of **R** is not correct.  It should start from the starting point of **D1** and (-**D2**).
