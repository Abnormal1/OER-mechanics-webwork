# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

A washer on the edge of a shelf supports three different forces, $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$, as shown.  What is the resultant force vector experienced by the washer, expressed in Cartesian form

Assume that the correct numerical answer to the problem above is $27.1142$ in the negative $x$ direction and $902.0661$ in the negative $y$ direction.  From the list below, select the best conclusion. 

a) A resultant force vector of $\overrightarrow{F}_R=(-27.1\hat{i}-902\hat{j})\;\mathrm{lb}$. 

b) The washer supports a resultant force vector of $\overrightarrow{F}_R=(-27.1\hat{i}-902\hat{j})\;\mathrm{lb}$. 

c) The washer supports a resultant force vector of $\overrightarrow{F}_R=(-27.1\hat{i}-902\hat{j})\;\mathrm{lb}$ due to force vectors. 

d) The washer supports a resultant force vector of $\overrightarrow{F}_R=(-27.1\hat{i}-902\hat{j})\;\mathrm{lb}$ due to the three force vectors shown in the diagram. 

# Answer:

d) The washer supports a resultant force vector of $\overrightarrow{F}_R=(-27.1\hat{i}-902\hat{j})\;\mathrm{lb}$ due to the three force vectors shown in the diagram. 

# Feedback:

a) The conclusion to a problem must provide a sentence that answers the original question.  This answer doesn't fully answer the stated question.

b) The conclusion to a problem must provide a sentence that answers the original question.  While this sentence isn't incorrect, there is another answer that is better because it is more precise.

c) The conclusion to a problem must provide a sentence that answers the original question.  While this answer isn't incorrect, the last phrase is vague and there is another answer that is better because it is more precise.

d) Good job! The conclusion to a problem must provide a sentence that answers the original question.  This answer does that, with all necessary specifics.
