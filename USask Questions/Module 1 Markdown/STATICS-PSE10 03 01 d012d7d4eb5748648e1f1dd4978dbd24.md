# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The hook depicted in the image below has two ropes pulling on it. The first rope is pulling with a force magnitude of $F_1=100\;\mathrm{N}$ and the second rope is pulling with a force magnitude of $F_2=150\;\mathrm{N}$.  The angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are $15\degree$and $10\degree$ respectively. What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes?

From the list below, select **all the correct assumptions** that should be made in order to solve the above problem. 

a) The ropes are taut

b) The ropes are inelastic

c) Gravity is $9.81\;\mathrm{m/s^2}$

d) Given information is exact

e) The hook and two ropes are in static equilibrium

f) The hook is rigid and does not deform

g) The springs are linear

h) The hook is frictionless

i) The hook is modelled as a particle

j) The ropes are modelled as a particle

k) The hook is modelled as a rigid body

# Answer:

a) The ropes are taut

b) The ropes are inelastic

d) Given information is exact

e) The hook and two ropes are in static equilibrium

i) The hook is modelled as a particle

# Feedback:

The **assumptions** section of your submission must list all pertinent assumptions that have beenmade in order to solve the problem. A thorough list of assumptions should be viewed as part of the answer to the problem. The numerical values you calculate are only useful if the assumptions used to obtain them are clear. In engineering practice, clarity about the conditions under which a numerical value was calculated is **very** important to ensure the value is not used under conditions where it is not valid.

Think about the assumptions presented. Do they all apply to the problem as stated? Are all the assumptions relevant to this particular situation? Of the ones that are relevant, do they make a true statement about the assumptions we need to solve the problem? Have you selected all the assumptions necessary for the given information? All of these questions must be considered when framing the assumptions of a problem. 

Note that the value of g is not needed to solve this problem, that there are no springs in this problem, that ropes are never particles, and that if the hook is considered to be a particle (a good assumption here), then it cannot also be a rigid body for the same question.  The hook could be assumed to be frictionless but that is not necessary in this problem.
