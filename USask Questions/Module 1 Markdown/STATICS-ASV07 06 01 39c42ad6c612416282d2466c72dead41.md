# Question:

For a vector with a magnitude of $[A]$ N directed at an angle of $[B]$Â° CCW from the positive $x$-axis, determine the $x$ and $y$ components to express the vector in Cartesian form:

$$\overrightarrow{v}=\left(\_\_\hat{i}+\_\_\hat{j}\right) \mathrm{N}$$

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (1, 20), 0 decimal places

$[B]:$ Range (90, 179), 0 decimal places

# Answer:

$$x=[A]\cos\left([B]\right)$$

$$y=[A]\sin\left([B]\right)$$

# Feedback:

To find the $x$ component from the magnitude and angle of a vector in Quadrant 2, multiply the magnitude by the cosine of the angle (as it measures from the **positive** $x$ axis). Remember, the $x$ component should end up negative in Quadrant 2. 

To find the $y$ component from the magnitude and angle of a vector in Quadrant 2, multiply the magnitude by the sine of the angle.
