# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

A hook screwed into a wall has two ropes pulling on it. The first rope is pulling with a force $F_1=100\;\mathrm{N}$ at an angle $\theta_1=15\degree$. The second rope is pulling with a force $F_2=150\;\mathrm{N}$ at an angle $\theta_2=80\degree$. What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes? Angles $\theta_1$  and $\theta_2$ are measured CCW from the positive $x$ axis.

---

Assume that the correct numerical answer to the problem above is $212.55246$.  From the list below, select the option ****depicting the best presentation of the **conclusion** with appropriate units. 

"The magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes is _____________."

a) $213\;\mathrm{kg\cdot m/s^2}$

b) $213\;\mathrm{N}$

c) $213\;\mathrm{lb}$

# Answer:

b) $213\;\mathrm{N}$

# Feedback:

a) The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units.  While the units shown in this answer are technically correct, the SI unit for force in Newtons. 

b) Good job! The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units.  Because the forces in the problem were given in terms of Newtons, the resultant force should also be presented in Newtons using the correct symbol, $\mathrm{N}$. 

c) The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units.  While the units shown in this answer can be used for force, these are not the force units used in the problem.
