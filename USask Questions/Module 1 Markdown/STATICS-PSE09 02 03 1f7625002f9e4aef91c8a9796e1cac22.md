# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The ring at point $A$ is attached by a spring to the wall at point $C$ and by a rope to another wall at point $B$, while being pulled by a second rope with force $F$. What is the unstretched length of the spring $AC$?

From the list below, select **the correct option** depicting the information that you need to **find** in the above problem.  

a) the length of the rope $AB$

b) the tension on spring $AC$

c) the tension force on point $A$

d) the unstretched length of the spring $AC$

# Answer:

d) the unstretched length of the spring $AC$

# Feedback:

a) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does not ask for the length of rope $AB$, although its value is unknown.

b) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does not ask for you to find the tension - in fact, it asks you to find out something about the spring **without** any tension on it. 

c) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. There is nothing in the problem statement about a tension force, so you do not need to find this. 

d) Good job! This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in this problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement directly asks for you to find "the unstretched length of the spring $AC$".
