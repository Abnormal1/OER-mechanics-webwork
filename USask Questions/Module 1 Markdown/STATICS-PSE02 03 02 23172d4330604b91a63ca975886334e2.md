- [ ]  Yes
- [ ]  No

# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

We say that an object is in equilibrium if it remains at rest if originally at rest, or has a constant velocity if originally in motion. This requires that all the forces acting on the object form a zero resultant force. The three forces shown in the FBD are all acting along different axes, which means the resultant force is definitely not zero. Thus, the particle is NOT in equilibrium.
