# Question:

From the options below, select the correct equation(s) that represent 2D particle static equilibrium, in terms of **Cartesian vector notation**.

a) $\sum{F}_x+\sum{F}_y=0$

b) $\sum{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum{F}_y=0$

c) $\sum\overrightarrow{F}=0$

d) $\sum F_x\hat{i}+\sum F_y\hat{j}=0$

# Answer:

d) $\sum F_x\hat{i}+\sum F_y\hat{j}=0$

# Feedback:

a) This answer is close, but it is missing the correct Cartesian vector notation.

b) This answer is correct for scalar representation of the equilibrium equations, but not for Cartesian vector notation.

c) This answer is correct for a general vector representation of equilibrium, but not for Cartesian vector notation.

d) Correct!  The scalar force components must be stated with their associated unit vectors for proper Cartesian vector notation.
