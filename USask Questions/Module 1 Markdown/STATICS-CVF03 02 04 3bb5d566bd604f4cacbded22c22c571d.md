# Answer:

$\vec{V}=-2\hat{i}+2\hat{j}+3\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

In three-dimensional space, vector $\vec{A}$ has three vector components: the *x-*component $\vec{A_x}=A_x\hat{i}$, which is the part of vector $\vec{A}$ along the *x-*axis; the *y-c*omponent $\vec{A_y}=A_y\hat{j}$, which is the part of $\vec{A}$along the *y-*axis; and the *z-*component $\vec{A_z}=A_z\hat{k}$, which is the part of the vector along the *z-*axis. A vector in three-dimensional space is the vector sum of its three vector components:

$$\vec{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}+A_z\hat{k}$$
