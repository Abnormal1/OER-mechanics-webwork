# Question:

Given the following **scalar** equations of equilibrium:

$$\sum{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum{F}_y=0,\;\;\overrightarrow{F}_z=0$$

Choose from the list below as to what should be fixed so that the above statements are correct. 

a) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be put on top of ${F}_x$ and ${F}_y$ and the summation sign $\Sigma$ should be added in front of $\overrightarrow{F}_z$.

b) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be removed from ${F}_z$, and the summation sign $\Sigma$ should be added in front of ${F}_z$

c) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be removed from $\overrightarrow{F}_z$ and the sum of all three components should equal zero together, not each separately

d) Only one equation is needed, $\sum\overrightarrow{F}=0$

# Answer:

b) The vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{}$, should be removed from ${F}_z$, and the summation sign $\Sigma$ should be added in front of ${F}_z$

# Feedback:

a) Because we are interested in the **scalar** equations of equilibrium, we want to express all three terms ${F}_x$, ${F}_y$, and ${F}_z$ as scalars, not vectors. 

b) Correct!  For correct scalar notation, the third term $\overrightarrow{F}_z$ needs the vector symbol removed, and the final term is missing the summation symbol, which is necessary for equilibrium. 

c) While the vector symbol should be removed from the $\overrightarrow{F}_z$ term, the sum of all the force scalars in the each direction must equal zero **separately**, not combined as a sum.

d) This statement would be true for vector notation, but not when expressing equilibrium in terms of scalar force components.
