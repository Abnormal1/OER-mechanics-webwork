# Answer:

Yes

# Feedback:

We say that an object is in equilibrium if it remains at rest if originally at rest, or has a constant velocity if originally in motion. This requires that all the forces acting on the object form a zero resultant force. In this question, $\overrightarrow{F_2}$ can be resolved into its horizontal and vertical components:

$$\overrightarrow{F_{2x}}=10\sqrt{2}~\text{N}\times\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=10 ~\text{N} \rightarrow$$

$$\overrightarrow{F_{2y}}=10\sqrt{2}~\text{N}\times\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=10 ~\text{N} \uparrow$$

We can see that $\overrightarrow{F_{2x}}$ and $\overrightarrow{F_{2y}}$ have the same magnitude as $\overrightarrow{F_1}$ and $\overrightarrow{W}$ and act in opposite directions. Therefore, the particle shown in this FBD is in equilibrium.
