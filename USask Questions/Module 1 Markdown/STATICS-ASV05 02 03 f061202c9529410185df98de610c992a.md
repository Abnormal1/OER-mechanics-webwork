# Question:

In which direction does the unit vector $\hat{j}$ point?

# Answer:

a) The positive $x$ direction

b) The negative $x$ direction

c) The positive $y$ direction

d) The negative $y$ direction

# Feedback:

a) The unit vector $\hat{j}$ points along the positive $y$ axis. 

b) All of the unit vectors in our coordinate system point along the positive axes. The unit vector $\hat{j}$ points along the positive $y$ axis. 

c) Correct! The unit vector $\hat{j}$ points along the positive $y$ axis. 

d) All of the unit vectors in our coordinate system point along the positive axes. The unit vector $\hat{j}$ points along the positive $y$ axis.
