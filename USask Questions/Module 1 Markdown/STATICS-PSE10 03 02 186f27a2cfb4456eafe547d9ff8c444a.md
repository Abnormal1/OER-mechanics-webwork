# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

If a downward force of $F=450\;\mathrm{lb}$ is applied to point $A$ in the strut system shown below, what is the force directed along strut $**A$$B$**?  The angle between the struts $\theta_A$ is $30\degree$and the angle between strut $AB$ and the downward force $F$ is $\theta_F=45\degree$.

From the list below, select **all the correct assumptions** that should be made in order to solve the above problem. 

a) The system is in static equilibrium

b) Gravity is $9.81\;\mathrm{m/s^2}$

c) Given information is exact

d) The struts are rigid and do not deform

e) The springs are linear

f) The struts are frictionless

g) The struts are modelled as a particle

h) Point $A$ is modelled as a particle

i) The strut system is modelled as a rigid body

# Answer:

a) The system is in static equilibrium

c) Given information is exact

d) The struts are rigid and do not deform

h) Point $A$ is modelled as a particle

# Feedback:

The **assumptions** section of your submission must list all pertinent assumptions that have beenmade in order to solve the problem. A thorough list of assumptions should be viewed as part of the answer to the problem. The numerical values you calculate are only useful if the assumptions used to obtain them are clear. In engineering practice, clarity about the conditions under which a numerical value was calculated is **very** important to ensure the value is not used under conditions where it is not valid.

Think about the assumptions presented. Do they all apply to the problem as stated? Are all the assumptions relevant to this particular situation? Of the ones that are relevant, do they make a true statement about the assumptions we need to solve the problem? Have you selected all the assumptions necessary for the given information? All of these questions must be considered when framing the assumptions of a problem. 

Note that the value of g is not needed in this problem, that there are no springs in this problem, that struts are neither "frictionless" nor particles, and that while the strut system could be considered to be a rigid system, that assumption is of no relevance in this problem.
