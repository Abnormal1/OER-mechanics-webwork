# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The ring at point $A$ is attached by a spring to the wall at point $C$ and a by a rope to another wall at point $B$, while being pulled by a second rope with force $F=600\;\mathrm{N}$. The spring $AC$ has a spring constant $k_{AC}=20\;\mathrm{N/m}$.  What is the unstretched length of the spring?

From the list below, select **the correct option** depicting the information that you need to **find** in the above problem.  

a) the unstretched length of the spring $AC$

b) the length of the rope $AB$

c) the tension force $F$

d) the spring constant, $k_{AC}$

# Answer:

a) the unstretched length of the spring $AC$

# Feedback:

a) Good job! This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement directly asks for you to find "the unstretched length of the spring", which we also know is spring $AC$.

b) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does not ask for the length of rope $AB$, although it is an unknown value.

c) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement gives the value for $F$ in the written description, even though it is not expressed in the diagram. 

d) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** in the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement gives the value for $k_{AC}$ in the written description, even though it is not expressed in the diagram.
