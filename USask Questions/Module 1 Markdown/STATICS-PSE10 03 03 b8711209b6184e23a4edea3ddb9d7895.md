# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The ring at point $A$ is attached by a spring to the wall at point $C$ and a by a rope to another wall at point $B$, while being pulled by a second rope with force $F=600\;\mathrm{N}$. The spring $AC$ has a spring constant $k_{AC}=20\;\mathrm{N/m}$. What is the unstretched length of the spring $AC$?

From the list below, select **all the correct assumptions** that should be made in order to solve the above problem. 

a) The ropes are taut

b) The ropes are inelastic

c) Gravity is $9.81\;\mathrm{m/s^2}$

d) Given information is exact

e) The spring and two ropes are in static equilibrium

f) The spring is rigid and does not deform

g) The spring is linear

h) The ring at point $A$ is frictionless

i) The spring is modelled as a particle

j) The ring at point $A$ is modelled as a particle

k) The spring is modelled as a rigid body

# Answer:

a) The ropes are taut

b) The ropes are inelastic

d) Given information is exact

e) The spring and two ropes are in static equilibrium

g) The spring is linear

j) The ring at point $A$ is modelled as a particle

# Feedback:

The **assumptions** section of your submission must list all pertinent assumptions that have beenmade in order to solve the problem. A thorough list of assumptions should be viewed as part of the answer to the problem. The numerical values you calculate are only useful if the assumptions used to obtain them are clear. In engineering practice, clarity about the conditions under which a numerical value was calculated is **very** important to ensure the value is not used under conditions where it is not valid.

Think about the assumptions presented. Do they all apply to the problem as stated? Are all the assumptions relevant to this particular situation? Of the ones that are relevant, do they make a true statement about the assumptions we need to solve the problem? Have you selected all the assumptions necessary for the given information? All of these questions must be considered when framing the assumptions of a problem. 

Note that the value of g is not needed for this problem, that springs are not rigid and are not modeled as particles, and that while one could say that the ring is frictionless, that isn't really necessary for this problem.
