# Question:

Consider the following three-dimensional vector represented in Cartesian form: 

$$\overrightarrow{v}=\left([A]\hat{i}+[B]\hat{j}+[C]\hat{k}\right) \mathrm{N}$$

Calculate the **magnitude** of the vector.

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (-1, -10), 0 decimal places

$[B]:$ Range (-1, -10), 0 decimal places

$[C]:$ Range (-1, -10), 0 decimal places

# Answer:

$$|\overrightarrow{v}|=\sqrt{[A]^2+[B]^2+[C]^2}$$

# Feedback:

To find the magnitude of a three-dimensional vector, square each of its scalar Cartesian components, add them together, and take the square root of the sum.
