# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The ring at point $A$ is attached by a spring to the wall at point $C$ and by a rope to another wall at point $B$, while being pulled by a second rope with force $F$. What is the unstretched length of the spring $AC$?

b) Dimensions

c) Dimensions and angles as shown

d) $\overrightarrow{F}=600\;\mathrm{N}$

e) $F=600\;\mathrm{N}$

f) $k_{AC}=20\;\mathrm{N/m}$

g) $K_{AC}=20\;\mathrm{N/m}$

h) Coordinate axes as shown

# Answer:

a) A ring is pulled by two ropes and a spring

c) Dimensions and angles as shown

e) $F=600\;\mathrm{N}$

f) $k_{AC}=20\;\mathrm{N/m}$

h) Coordinate axes as shown

# Feedback:

Every piece of work submitted in engineering practice should be self-contained and effective in presenting the problem addressed and the analysis method used. For each problem in this course, your submitted work should be divided into five parts, each with its own clearly marked heading:

- Given
- Find
- Assumptions
- Analysis
- Conclusions

This question asks you to identify the correct information required in the **Given** section of your submission. This section must provide a clear text summary of the information provided in the problem statement and diagram (if any). This does not mean copying verbatim from the problem statement. All pertinent information and data must be extracted from the problem statement and listed. And there is no need to recopy complex diagrams provided with the problem statement, although additional annotations on the diagram may be appropriate.

The **Given** section is presented as a bulleted list. The bullet points will be of four general types:

- providing a brief description of the scenario being analyzed
- directing the reader to illustrations with key information
- listing variables and their values
- noting coordinate systems, if any are provided

**Common Errors** include:

- Simply stating "see figure" - more information should be stated, like "see figure for dimensions"
- Missing key information - a force, angle, mass, or other piece of information given in the problem statement
- Mis-stating key information - missing the units, stating incorrect unit, stating an incorrect value, etc.
- Mis-stating variable symbols - missing a subscript notation, using a capital letter instead of a lower case, using the wrong letter, etc.
- Mixing scalars and vectors - writing a vector as a scalar or vice versa is a different form of mis-stating information and misrepresents key values in the problem

In this problem, make sure you note where the dimensions are e.g. "dimensions as shown", write vectors with magnitude and direction and scalars with just a magnitude, and spring constants are k, not K.
