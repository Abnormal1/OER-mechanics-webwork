# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The hook depicted in the image below has two ropes pulling on it. What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the ook due to the two ropes?

From the list below, select **all the correct assumptions** that should be made in order to solve the above problem. 

a) The ropes are taut

b) The ropes are inelastic

c) Gravity is $9.81\;\mathrm{m/s^2}$

d) Given information is exact

e) The hook and two ropes are in static equilibrium

f) The hook is rigid and does not deform

g) The springs are linear

h) The hook is frictionless

i) The hook is modelled as a particle

j) The ropes are modelled as a particle

k) The hook is modelled as a rigid body

# Answer:

a) The ropes are taut

b) The ropes are inelastic

d) Given information is exact

e) The hook and two ropes are in static equilibrium

i) The hook is modelled as a particle

# Feedback:

The **assumptions** section of your submission must list all pertinent assumptions that have beenmade in order to solve the problem. A thorough list of assumptions should be viewed as part of the answer to the problem. The numerical values you calculate are only useful if the assumptions used to obtain them are clear. In engineering practice, clarity about the conditions under which a numerical value was calculated is **very** important to ensure the value is not used under conditions where it is not valid.

Think about the assumptions presented. Do they all apply to the problem as stated? Are all the assumptions relevant to this particular situation? Of the ones that are relevant, do they make a true statement about the assumptions we need to solve the problem? Have you selected all the assumptions necessary for the given information? All of these questions must be considered when framing the assumptions of a problem. 

Note that the value of g isn't needed to answer this problem, there are no springs in this problem, ropes are never particles, the hook is best considered to be a particle here so it is neither rigid nor a rigid body, and while saying the hook is frictionless is not wrong, it's not really necessary required to solve this problem.
