# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

The hook depicted in the image below has two ropes pulling on it. What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes?

From the list below, select **the correct option** depicting the information that you need to **find** in the above problem.  

a) the resultant force vector acting on the hook

b) the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes

c) variables $x$ and $y$

d) the angle of the resultant force vector acting on the hook

# Answer:

b) the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes

# Feedback:

a) This question asks you to identify the correct information that you are required to **Find**. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does not ask for you to find a vector, so this option is incorrect. 

b) Good job! This question asks you to identify the correct information that you are required to  **Find**. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. No notation is given in the question, so re-stating the sentence describing "the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes" is the correct answer. 

c) This question asks you to identify the correct information that you are required to **Find**. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. While $x$ and $y$ may seem like variables in this diagram, they are actually labels for the $x$ and $y$ axes, respectively, so they do not need to be solved. 

d) This question asks you to identify the correct information that you are required to **Find**. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does not ask for you to find an angle, so this option is incorrect.
