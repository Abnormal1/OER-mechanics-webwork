# Feedbackï¼š

### Answer specific feedback:

a. Well done! This is the correct FBD for the block.

b. The tricky part of this question is to figure out the angle between the spring force vector and the reference axis. See below for how to find this angle.

c. The tricky part of this question is to figure out the angle between the spring force vector and the reference axis. See below for how to find this angle. Also, without the spring, the block would slide down the inclined surface. Therefore, we can see that the spring must have been stretched and it would provide a force acting to the top right. 

d. Without the spring, the block would slide down the inclined surface. Therefore, we can see that the spring must have been stretched and it would provide a force acting to the top right. 

### General feedback:

The tricky part of this question is to figure out the angle between the spring force vector and the reference axis. As shown in the figure below,  the angle between $\overrightarrow{F_S}$ and the positive x-axis is the sum of $\theta$ and $45^\circ$.  Then to find $\theta$, we can use the geometry of triangle ABC:

$$\theta=\tan^{-1}(\frac{0.3}{0.4})=36.9^\circ$$

Thus, the total angle is $36.9^\circ+45^\circ=81.9^\circ$.
