# Question:

Consider the following scenario:

---

If a downward force of $F=450\;\mathrm{lb}$ is applied to point $A$ in the strut system shown below, what is the force directed along strut $**A$$B$**?  The angle between the struts $\theta_A$ is $30\degree$and the angle between strut $AB$ and the downward force $F$ is $\theta_F=45\degree$.

From the list below, select **the correct option** depicting the information that you need to **find** in the above problem.  

a) the angle between the struts, $\theta_A$

b) the force directed along strut $A$$B$

c) the angle between strut $AB$ and force $F$, $\theta_F$

d) the distance between points $B$ and $C$

# Answer:

b) the force directed from point $A$ to point $B$

# Feedback:

a) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** when solving the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement actually gives the value of the angle $\theta_A$ in the written description, although it is not stated in the diagram. 

b) Good job! This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** when solving the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. No notation is given in the question, so re-stating the desired information as "the force directed along strut $A$$B$" is the correct answer. 

c) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** when solving the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement actually gives the value of the angle $\theta_F$ in the written description, although it is not stated in the diagram. 

d) This question asks you to identify what it is that you are supposed to **Find** when solving the problem. This section must contain a concise list of the information that you are looking for, including proper notation. The problem statement does not ask for you to find any distances, but instead, a force.
