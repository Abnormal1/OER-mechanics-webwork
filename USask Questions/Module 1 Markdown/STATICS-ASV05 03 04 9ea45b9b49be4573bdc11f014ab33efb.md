# Question:

Select the multiple choice answer that best fills in the blank:

"A _______ **vector** is a normalized spatial vector that has a length of one."

# Answer:

a) Unit

b) Scalar

c) Zero

d) Position

# Feedback:

a) Correct! A normalized vector with a length of one is called a **unit vector**. 

b) Any vector has a direction and magnitude, so it cannot be a scalar. A normalized vector with a length of one is called a **unit vector**. 

c) A zero vector doesn't have a length. A normalized vector with a length of one is called a **unit vector**. 

d) A position vector indicates the distance and direction taken to a specific point. A normalized vector with a length of one is called a **unit vector**.
