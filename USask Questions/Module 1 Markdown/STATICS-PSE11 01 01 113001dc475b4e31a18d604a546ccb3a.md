# Question:

From the options below, select the correct equation that represents 2D particle static equilibrium, in terms of **vector** notation.

a) $\sum\overrightarrow{F}_x=0,\;\; \sum\overrightarrow{F}_y=0$

b) $\sum\overrightarrow{F}=0$

c) $\sum{F}=0$

d) $\sum{F}_x+{F}_y=0$

# Answer:

b) $\sum\overrightarrow{F}=0$

# Feedback:

a) These equations (plural) are the conditions for 2D static equilibrium.  However, this question asked for the vector equation (singular) for static equilibrium, which does not need to be separated between the $x$ and $y$ components. 

b) Correct! The sum of all the force vectors in the problem must add to zero in order to have static equilibrium.

c) This answer is close, but note that this question asked for the equilibrium equation in vector notation.

d) This answer is not a correct equation for static equilibrium, and it is not stated in vector notation.
