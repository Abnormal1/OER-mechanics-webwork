Consider the following scenario:



The ring at point A is attached by a spring to the wall at point C and by a rope to another wall at point B, while being pulled by a second rope with force F. What is the unstretched length of the spring AC?




From the list below, select all the correct assumptions that should be made in order to solve the above problem. 

",

"b) The ropes are inelastic",

"d) Given information is exact",

"e) The spring and two ropes are in static equilibrium",

"g) The spring is linear",

"j) The ring at point A is modelled as a particle",
