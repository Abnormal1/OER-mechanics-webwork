Consider the following scenario:



The hook depicted in the image below has two ropes pulling on it. The first rope is pulling with a force magnitude of \(F_1\)=100N and the second rope is pulling with a force magnitude of \(F_2\)=150 N.  The angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) are 15 \(^\circ\)and 10 \(^\circ\) respectively. What is the magnitude of the resultant force acting on the hook due to the two ropes?




From the list below, select all the correct assumptions that should be made in order to solve the above problem. 

",
"a) The ropes are taut",

"b) The ropes are inelastic",

"d) Given information is exact",

"e) The hook and two ropes are in static equilibrium",

"i) The hook is modelled as a particle",
);
$mc -> makeLast("a) The ropes are taut",
"b) The ropes are inelastic",
"c) Gravity is 9.81m/s^2",
"d) Given information is exact",
"e) The hook and two ropes are in static equilibrium",
"f) The hook is rigid and does not deform",
"g) The springs are linear",
"h) The hook is frictionless",
"i) The hook is modelled as a particle",
"j) The ropes are modelled as a particle",
"k) The hook is modelled as a rigid body",
