# Answer:

5

# Feedback:

Since these couples are equivalent, they must produce a moment with the same magnitude and direction.  We can see that both couples cause a tendency of CW rotation, and the magnitude of the moment produced by these two couples can be calculated from the diagrams as: 

$$ |\overrightarrow{M}|=25~\text{lb}~(6 ~\text{ft})=30~\text{lb}~(d ~\text{ft})= 150~\text{lb}\cdot\text{ft}$$

Solving for $d$ in the right hand diagram, 

$$d=\frac{150~\text{lb}\cdot\text{ft}}{30~\text{lb}}=5~\text{ft}$$
