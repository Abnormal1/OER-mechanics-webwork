# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

The moment of a force $\overrightarrow{F}$ about point O, can be expressed using a vector cross product:

$$ ‚Åç$$

where $\overrightarrow{r}$ represents a position vector directed from point O to any point on the line of action of $\overrightarrow{F}$

In this question, $\overrightarrow{r}_{OA}$ does not go through the line of action of the 100 N force, thus it **CANNOT** be used as the position vector for calculating the moment of the force about point O.
