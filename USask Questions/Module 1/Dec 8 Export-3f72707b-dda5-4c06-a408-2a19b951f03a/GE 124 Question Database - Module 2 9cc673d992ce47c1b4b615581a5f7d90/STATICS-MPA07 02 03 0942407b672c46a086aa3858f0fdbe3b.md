Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

Determining the moment about point O in a 3D problem requires taking the cross product between a position vector depicting the moment arm, and the force vector. If each vector is depicted in Cartesian coordinates as such:

$$\overrightarrow{r}=\hat{i}+3\hat{j}-2\hat{k}\\\overrightarrow{F}=-6\hat{i}+4\hat{j}-6\hat{k}$$

then select the correct representation of the determinant expansion of the vector moment calculation:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=[-6]\hat{i}-[3(4)]\hat{j}+[-2(-6)]\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=[3(-6)-(-2)(4)]\hat{i}+[-6-(-2)(-6)]\hat{j}+[4-3(-6)]\hat{k}$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=[3(-6)-(-2)(4)]\hat{i}-[-6-(-2)(-6)]\hat{j}+[4-3(-6)]\hat{k}$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=[4-3(-6)]\hat{i}-[3(-6)-(-2)(4)]\hat{j}+[-6-(-2)(-6)]\hat{k}$

# Answer:

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=[3(-6)-(-2)(4)]\hat{i}-[-6-(-2)(-6)]\hat{j}+[4-3(-6)]\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) This option shows a pattern that more closely resembles the **dot product**. The moment due to a force is calculated with a **cross product**, whose 3D determinant is calculated using the pattern below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

The numbers in the vectors given need to be placed in the matrix properly and the determinant must be calculated as shown.

b) While the order and pattern of terms in this option is correct, itâ€™s missing a negative sign. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

Make sure you keep the negative sign in front of the $\hat{j}$ term!

c) Correct! Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

This option shows the correct order of numbers! Remember the negative sign in front of the $\hat{j}$ term in the middle.

d) While the pattern of terms within the brackets is correct, their order is not. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

The y & z components are paired with the $\hat{i}$ term, the x & z components with the $\hat{j}$ term, and the x & y components with the $\hat{k}$ term. Even though the vectors in this problem are presented with different variables, the pattern remains the same.
