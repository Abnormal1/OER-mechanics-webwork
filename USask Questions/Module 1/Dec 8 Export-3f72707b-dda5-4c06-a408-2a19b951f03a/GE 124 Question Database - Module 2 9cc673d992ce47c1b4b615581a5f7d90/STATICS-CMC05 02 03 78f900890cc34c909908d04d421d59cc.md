# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

If two couples produce a moment with the same magnitude and direction, then these two couples are equivalent. In this question, both couples cause a tendency of CW rotation. However, the couple on the left hand side has a moment of $|\overrightarrow{M}|=40~\text{lb}~(2 ~\text{ft})= 80~\text{lb}\cdot\text{ft}$. The couple on the right hand side has a moment of $|\overrightarrow{M}|=20~\text{lb}~(5 ~\text{ft})= 100~\text{lb}\cdot\text{ft}$. Thus, the two couples presented in this question are **NOT** equivalent.
