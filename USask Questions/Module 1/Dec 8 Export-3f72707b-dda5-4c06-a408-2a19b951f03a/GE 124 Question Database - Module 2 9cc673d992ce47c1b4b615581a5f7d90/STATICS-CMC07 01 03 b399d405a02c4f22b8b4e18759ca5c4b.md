# Question:

Which of the following options can be described as a **free vector?**

a) Couple moment vector

b) Moment vector

c) Force vector

# Answer:

a) Couple moment vector

# Feedback:

a) Correct! A couple moment is a **free vector** i.e. it has magnitude and direction and can act at *any point* on a body.  

b) A moment vector is **not** a free vector since its location determines its magnitude and sense.  It is created by a force acting at a distance away from a point or axis of rotation.  If we move the point or axis, then the moment can change.  We can describe something as a **free vector** if the point of application (or calculation) of the vector does not matter where it occurs i.e. it can be applied at any point on a body or can be calculated at any point on a body. 

c) A force vector is **not** a free vector since the location of the vector matters very much. We can describe something as a **free vector** if the point of application (or calculation) of the vector does not matter where it occurs i.e. it can be applied at any point on a body or can be calculated at any point on a body.
