# Question:

In the diagram below, do the two force vectors $\overrightarrow{F}_A$ and $\overrightarrow{F}_B$ create a couple moment? The magnitudes of the two vectors are the same value.

a) Yes

b) No

# Answer:

b) No

# Feedback:

a) A couple moment is created when there are two force vectors **parallel** to each other of equal magnitude but opposite direction, and separated by a perpendicular distance. The vectors in this diagram are not parallel. 

b) Well done! A couple moment is created when there are two force vectors **parallel** to each other of equal magnitude but opposite direction, and separated by a perpendicular distance.
