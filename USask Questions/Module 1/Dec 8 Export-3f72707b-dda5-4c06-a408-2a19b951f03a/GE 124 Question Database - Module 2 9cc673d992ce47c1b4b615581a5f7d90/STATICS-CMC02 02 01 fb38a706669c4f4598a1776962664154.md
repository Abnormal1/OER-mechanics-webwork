Topic/ Unit: 3. Incorporate couples in moment calculations (CMC)

# Question:

In the diagram below, there are multiple couples. The two force vectors in red, $\overrightarrow{F}_A$ and $\overrightarrow{F}_B$, create one couple moment.  What is the **sense** of tendency of rotation due to the couple moment created by the force vectors in red?

a) CW

b) CCW

# Answer:

b) CCW

# Feedback:

a) If you imagine pulling in the direction of each of the red vectors in the diagram, the triangle will have a tendency to rotate in the counter-clockwise (CCW) sense. 

b) Good job! Try to imagine pulling in the direction of each of the red vectors in the diagram, and seeing which sense the triangle would have a tendency to rotate in.
