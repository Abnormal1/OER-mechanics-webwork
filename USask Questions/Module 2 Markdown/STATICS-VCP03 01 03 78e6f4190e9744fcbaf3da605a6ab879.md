# Automatic Feedback

### Answer Specific Feedback:

a. Good job! The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0 and no cross product vector is shown.

b. The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0.

c. The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0.

d. The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0.
