Which of the following notations can be used to represent the reaction force **vector** at $\text{C}$? 

# Answer:

a. $\bold{F_{DC}}$

b. $\text{F}_\text{DC}$

c. $\overrightarrow{F}_\text{CD}$

d. $|\overrightarrow{F}_\text{DC}|$

# Feedback:

### Answer specific feedback:

a. Good job! See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

b. This is a scalar notation. This question asked for a vector notation. See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

c. This is a correct form of vector notation. However, the subscript indicates the force is directed from $\text{C}$ to $\text{D}$. Let's analyze the scenario again. When you push down at point $\text{B}$, $\text{CD}$ should be in compression. Therefore, the reaction force on the member at $\text{C}$ should be directed from $\text{D}$ to $\text{C}$.

d. This is a scalar notation. This question asked for a vector notation. See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

### General feedback:

It is common to confuse vector notation with scalar notation. Note the following accepted notations for both:

$$\mathrm{vector}:\overrightarrow{A}\;\mathrm{or}\;\bold{A}$$

$$\mathrm{scalar}:|\overrightarrow{A}|\;\mathrm{or}\;\text{A}$$

Vector values are typically represented by a bolded letter, $\bold{A}$, or with an arrow on top, $\overrightarrow{A}$.
