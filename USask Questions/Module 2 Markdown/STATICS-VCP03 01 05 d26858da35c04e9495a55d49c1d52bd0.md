# Automatic Feedback

### Answer Specific Feedback:

a. The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0.

b. The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0.

c. Well done! The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0 and no cross product vector is shown.

d. The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0.
