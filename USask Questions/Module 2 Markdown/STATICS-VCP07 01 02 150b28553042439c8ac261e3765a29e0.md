Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 3D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=\alpha\hat{i}+\beta\hat{j}+\gamma\hat{k}\\\overrightarrow{B}=U\hat{i}+V\hat{j}+W\hat{k}\\$$

From the options below, select the correct representation of the 3 x 3 matrix needed to calculate the determinant:

a) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}$

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}x&y&z\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}$

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}$

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\U&V&W\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\\end{vmatrix}$

# Answer:

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}$

# Feedback:

a) When setting up the 3 x 3 matrix for 3D vectors, the unit vectors must be included as the first row. The first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ is then set up in the second row, and the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ is set in the third row, with components placed left to right.  This option is missing a row. 

b) When setting up the 3 x 3 matrix for 3D vectors, the unit vectors must be included as the first row. The first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ is then set up in the second row, and the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ is set in the third row, with components placed left to right.  The first row in this option is not stated using the correct notation i.e. these are not unit vectors. 

c) Correct! When setting up the 3 x 3 matrix for 3D vectors, the unit vectors must be included as the first row. The first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ is then set up in the second row, and the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ is set in the third row, with components placed left to right. 

d) When setting up the 3 x 3 matrix for 3D vectors, the unit vectors must be included as the first row. The first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ is then set up in the second row, and the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ is set in the third row, with components placed left to right. This option has the order of the $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$ vectors reversed.
