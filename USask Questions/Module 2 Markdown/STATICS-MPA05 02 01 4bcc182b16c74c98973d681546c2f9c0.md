Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

A force vector is applied to a strut, which will create a tendency to rotate the strut clockwise as a result. Both the force vector and the moment arm exist in the xy plane. If the magnitude of the moment about the axis is 15.3 Nâˆ™m, select the correct vector representation of the moment.

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{-15.3\,\mathrm{N\cdot
m}\}\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{-15.3\,\mathrm{N\cdot
m}\}\hat{i}$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{-15.3\,\mathrm{N\cdot
m}\}$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{15.3\,\mathrm{N\cdot
m}\}\hat{k}$

# Answer:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{-15.3\,\mathrm{N\cdot
m}\}\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) Well done! In this 2D problem, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$. Because the sense of the moment is clockwise, the sign of the value is negative. Remember to always report your answer with correct units!

b) This option has an incorrect unit vector. In a 2D problem like this, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$. Because the sense of the moment is clockwise, the sign of the value is negative, which is correctly stated here.

c) This option is missing a unit vector. In a 2D problem like this, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$. Because the sense of the moment is clockwise, the sign of the value is negative, which is correctly stated here.

d) The sign in this option is incorrect. Because the sense of the moment is clockwise, the sign of the value is negative. Otherwise the unit vector notation is correct! In this 2D problem, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$.
