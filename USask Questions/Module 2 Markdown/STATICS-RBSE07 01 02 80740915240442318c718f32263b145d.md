Assume you have solved this problem.  The FBD below shows your calculated values. 

![STATICS-RBSE07%2001%2002%2080740915240442318c718f32263b145d/Untitled.png](STATICS-RBSE07%2001%2002%2080740915240442318c718f32263b145d/Untitled.png)

From the list of potential conclusions shown below, select the best conclusion.

# Answer:

a. The reaction forces are 8.00 $\text{kN}\leftarrow$, 4.00 $\text{kN}\downarrow$, and 11.3 $\text{kN}\nearrow$.

b. The horizontal and vertical components of reaction at the pin $\text{A}$ are 8.00 $\text{kN}\leftarrow$ and 4.00 $\text{kN}\downarrow$, respectively.

c. The horizontal and vertical components of reaction at the pin $\text{A}$ are 8.00 $\text{kN}\leftarrow$ and 4.00 $\text{kN}\downarrow$, respectively, and the reaction on the beam at $\text{C}$ is 11.3 $\text{kN}$ along the direction of member $\text{DC}$

d. $\text{A}_\text{x}=8.00 ~\text{kN}\leftarrow$, $\text{A}_\text{y}=4.00 ~\text{kN}\downarrow$, and $\text{F}_\text{CD}=11.3 ~\text{kN}\nearrow$.

# Feedback:

a. In addition to stating the numerical results, you also need to be clear about the direction and **location** of the forces. 

b. The question also asked about the reaction forces at $\text{C}$, which is missing from this conclusion. 

c. Well done! The conclusion to a problem must provide an informative sentence that answers the original question.  This answer does that, with all necessary specifics. 

d. The information in this conclusion is comprehensive and correct.  However, a conclusion to a problem should provide an informative **sentence** that answers the original question.
