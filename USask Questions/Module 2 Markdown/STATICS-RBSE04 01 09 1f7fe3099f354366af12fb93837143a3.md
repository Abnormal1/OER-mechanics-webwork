# Feedback:

a. The collar at A is free to slide along the inclined (blue) rod. Therefore, the tangential reaction force, $\text{N}_\text{Ax}$, should not be there.

b. The rod which is our free body is rigidly connected to the the collar at A. Although the collar is free to slide over the inclined (blue) rod, it is not free to rotate (in the x-y plane). Therefore, a moment reaction is missing in this FBD, and the tangential reaction force, $\text{N}_\text{Ax}$, should not be there.

c. Good job! This is the correct FBD for the member, and you should be able to solve for the reaction forces based on this FBD.

d. The rod which is our free body is rigidly connected to the the collar at A. Although the collar is free to slide over the inclined (blue) rod, it is not free to rotate (in the x-y plane). Therefore, a moment reaction is missing in this FBD.
