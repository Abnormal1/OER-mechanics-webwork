Assume you have solved this problem.  The FBD below shows your calculated values. If this question requires you to round your final results to three sig figs, select the best presentation of the conclusion in the form "The reaction of the roller $\text{B}$ is __________ $\text{kN}$ upwards." from the list below.

# Answer:

a. 8.0474

b. 8.05

c. 8.0

d. 8

# Feedback:

a. This answer has five sig figs. To round a number to three significant figures, first, you need to determine which digit is the third significant figure. In this case, the third significant figure is on the hundredths place. Then look at one digit to the right of the hundredths place and round accordingly.

b. Well done! This answer is rounded to three sig figs correctly, with a round up of the 3rd sig fig.

c. This answer has two sig figs. To round a number to three significant figures, first, you need to determine which digit is the third significant figure. In this case, the third significant figure is on the hundredths place. Then look at one digit to the right of the hundredths place and round accordingly.

d. This answer only has one sig fig. To round a number to three significant figures, first, you need to determine which digit is the third significant figure. In this case, the third significant figure is in the hundredths place. Then look at one digit to the right of the hundredths place and round accordingly.
