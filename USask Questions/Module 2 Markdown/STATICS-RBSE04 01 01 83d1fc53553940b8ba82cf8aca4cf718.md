# Feedback:

a. Well done! This is the correct FBD for member AC, and you should be able to solve for the cable tension and the reaction forces based on this FBD.

b. The directions of the cable tensions are incorrect in this FBD. 

c. A pin support is free to rotate. Thus there should be only two unknowns associated with a pin support, i.e., $F_x$ and $F_y$.

d. This is the correct FBD for the pully. However, it can not help us to solve for the cable tension and reaction forces at pin $A$. You should construct the FBD for member AC.
