# Feedback:

a. Good job! This is the correct FBD for the member, and you should be able to solve for the reactions at $\text{A}$ and the cable tension based on this FBD.

b. There are five unknowns associated with a thrust bearing support. The reactions are three forces ($\bold{A_x}$, $\bold{A_y}$  and $\bold{A_z}$) and two couple-moment components ($\bold{M_{Ax}}$ and $\bold{M_{Az}}$). A thrust bearing may look very similar to a journal bearing, but the difference is that a thrust bearing can provide force resistance along the member's axis, while a journal bearing does not. 

c.  Note the member is free to rotate about the y-axis at the thrust bearing at $\text{A}$. Thus, $\bold{M_{Ay}}$ should not be there.  All of the other reactions are appropriate though.  Note that a thrust bearing may look very similar to a journal bearing, but the difference is that a thrust bearing can provide force resistance along the member's axis, while a journal bearing does not. 

d. One of the force reactions, $\bold{A_y}$, is missing in this FBD. There are five unknowns associated with a thrust bearing support. The reactions are three forces ($\bold{A_x}$, $\bold{A_y}$  and $\bold{A_z}$) and two couple-moment components ($\bold{M_{Ax}}$ and $\bold{M_{Az}}$). A thrust bearing may look very similar to a journal bearing, but the difference is that a thrust bearing can provide force resistance along the member's axis, while a journal bearing does not.
