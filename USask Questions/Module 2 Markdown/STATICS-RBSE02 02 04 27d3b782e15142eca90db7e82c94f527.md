Topic/ Unit: 4. Determine unknown forces and moments that will achieve static equilibrium (2D and 3D) for simple rigid bodies (RBSE)

# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

The smooth uniform rod $AB$ is supported by a ball-and-socket joint at $A$, the wall at $B$, and cable $BC$. Determine the components of reaction at $A$, the tension in the cable, and the normal reaction at $B$ if the rod has a mass of $20\,\mathrm{kg}$.

From the list below, select the option with **the best list of information** that is **given** in the above problem:

---

---

a) A uniform rod supported by a ball-and-socket joint, the wall, and a cable

See diagram for dimensions

$W_{\mathrm{rod}}=20\,\mathrm{kg}$

Coordinate axes as shown

---

b) A uniform rod 

See diagram for dimensions

$m_{\mathrm{rod}}=20\,\mathrm{kg}$

Coordinate axes as shown

---

c) A uniform rod supported by a ball-and-socket joint, the wall, and a cable

See diagram for dimensions

$m_{\mathrm{rod}}=20\,\mathrm{kg}$

Coordinate axes as shown

---

d) A uniform rod supported by a ball-and-socket joint, the wall, and a cable

See diagram

$m_{\mathrm{rod}}=20\,\mathrm{kg}$

Coordinate axes as shown

# Answer:

c) A uniform rod supported by a ball-and-socket joint, the wall, and a cable

See diagram for dimensions

$m_{\mathrm{rod}}=20\,\mathrm{kg}$

Coordinate axes as shown

# Feedback:

a) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly, as well as referencing the coordinate axes. However, the variable used for mass is not correct. Remember that "mass" and "weight" are different - **weight** is a downward force, but **mass** must be multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity to produce a downward force. 

b) This option refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly, and the value given for mass is stated correctly. The coordinate axes are also referenced. However, the descriptive sentence is lacking information. When providing a description, try to include all the components of the scenario that are relevant.

c) Correct! This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly. The mass of the rod is stated properly, and the coordinate axes are referenced. This is all the information "given" in this problem.

d) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and the value given for mass is stated correctly. However, the line about dimensions is incomplete. When referring to dimensions in a diagram, you must use the complete phrase "dimensions **as shown**", or "**see diagram for** dimensions".
