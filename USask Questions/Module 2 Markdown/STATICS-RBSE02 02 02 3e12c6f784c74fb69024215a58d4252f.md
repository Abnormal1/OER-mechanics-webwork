# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

The $50\,\mathrm{lb}$ mulching machine has a center of gravity at $G$. Determine the vertical reactions at the wheels $C$ and $B$ and the smooth contact point $A$.

From the list below, select the option with **the best list of information** that is **given** in the above problem:

---

---

a) A mulching machine 

See diagram for dimensions

${W}_{\mathrm{machine}}=50\,\mathrm{lb}$

Coordinate axes as shown

---

b) A mulching machine with two wheels and one smooth contact point

See diagram for dimensions

Coordinate axes as shown

---

c) A mulching machine with two wheels and one smooth contact point

See diagram for dimensions

${W}_{\mathrm{machine}}=50\,\mathrm{lb}$

---

d) A mulching machine with two wheels and one smooth contact point

See diagram for dimensions

${W}_{\mathrm{machine}}=50\,\mathrm{lb}$

Coordinate axes as shown

# Answer:

d) A mulching machine with two wheels and one smooth contact point

See diagram for dimensions

${W}_{\mathrm{machine}}=50\,\mathrm{lb}$

Coordinate axes as shown

# Feedback:

a) This option refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly, and the values for the weight of the plate. The coordinate axes are also referenced appropriately. However, the descriptive sentence is lacking information. When providing a description, try to include all the components of the scenario that are relevant.

b) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly, as well as referencing the coordinate axes. However, there is an important value missing from this list. The weight of machine was given in the description of the problem, and should be stated as a variable in the list. 

c) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly. The value for the weight of the machine is also stated properly. However, there is a set of coordinate axes clearly shown in the diagram, and those should be referenced. Choose an answer that refers to these axes. 

d) Correct! This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly. The value for the weight of the machine is stated properly, and the coordinate axes are referenced. This is all the information "given" in this problem.
