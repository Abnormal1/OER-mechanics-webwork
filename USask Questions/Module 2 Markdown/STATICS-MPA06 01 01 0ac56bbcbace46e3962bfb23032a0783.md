Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

The 2D diagram below depicts a force vector being applied to a strut:

![STATICS-MPA06%2001%2001%200ac56bbcbace46e3962bfb23032a0783/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA06%2001%2001%200ac56bbcbace46e3962bfb23032a0783/Untitled.png)

The Cartesian representation of both the force vector and the position vector describing the moment arm are:

$$\overrightarrow{r}=\{-5\hat{i}-2\hat{j}\}\,\mathrm{m}\\\overrightarrow{F}=\{\hat{i}-4\hat{j}\}\,\mathrm{N}$$

Calculate the moment created by force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$ about point O.  Submit your answer in natural numbers with the correct positive or negative sign, in the blank below:

$$\overrightarrow{M}_O = \{\_\_\_\_\,\mathrm{N \cdot m}\}\hat{k}$$

# Answer:

$$\overrightarrow{M}_O = \{22\,\,\mathrm{N \cdot m}\}\hat{k}$$

# Feedback:

When given the Cartesian representation of the force vector and an appropriate position vector in a problem like the one shown, you can use the cross product to find the vector moment, as:

$$\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}r_x&r_y\\F_x&F_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$$

For this particular problem, the determinant is:

$$\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}-5&-2\\1&-4\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$$

Which can be depicted in term-by-term representation as:

$$\overrightarrow{M}_O=(r_xF_y-r_yF_x)\hat{k}$$

It is important to use the proper positive/negative sign for each of the components. If done properly, the mathematical result of the determinant will have the correct sign depicting the sense of the moment (in this case, the strut would rotate in a counter-clockwise direction around point O, so the moment should be **positive**).
