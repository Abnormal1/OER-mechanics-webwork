Topic/ Unit: 4. Determine unknown forces and moments that will achieve static equilibrium (2D and 3D) for simple rigid bodies (RBSE)

# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

The uniform plate below has a weight of $500\,\mathrm{lb}$. Determine the tensions in each of the supporting cables.

From the list below, select the option that **is acceptable** as a list of information that you are required to **find** in this problem:  

---

a) $\overrightarrow{T}$, the tensions in each of the supporting cables

b) $\overrightarrow{F}$, the downward force applied to the plate

c) $\overrightarrow{T}_A, \overrightarrow{T}_B, \overrightarrow{T}_C$, the tensions in each of the supporting cables

d) $\overrightarrow{W}_{\mathrm{plate}}$, the weight of the plate

---

# Answer:

c) $\overrightarrow{T}_A, \overrightarrow{T}_B, \overrightarrow{T}_C$, the tensions in each of the supporting cables

# Feedback:

a) Close! While the sentence in this option is stated correctly, there is only one variable shown. There are three different ropes and the problem asks for the tensions in **each** of the supporting cables. Therefore, there must be three separate variable results. 

b) In the diagram, the downward force is given as $200\,\mathrm{lb}$, so this is not something unknown. Look for words like "determine", "solve for", and "find" to tell you what you need to **find** in the problem. 

c) Well done! This problem is asking for the tension in each of the cables, which could be denoted by $\overrightarrow{T}_A, \overrightarrow{T}_B,$ and $\overrightarrow{T}_C$. Note that depicting these variables as scalars would also be acceptable. 

d) In the diagram, the weight of the plate is given as $500\,\mathrm{lb}$, so this is not something unknown. Look for words like "determine", "solve for", and "find" to tell you what you need to **find** in the problem.
