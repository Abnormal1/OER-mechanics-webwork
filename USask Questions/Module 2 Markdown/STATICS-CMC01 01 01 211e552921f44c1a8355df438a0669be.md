# Question:

In the diagram below, do the two force vectors $\overrightarrow{F}_A$ and $\overrightarrow{F}_B$ create a couple moment? The magnitudes of the two vectors are the same value.

a) Yes

b) No

# Answer:

b) No

# Feedback:

a) A couple moment is created when there are two force vectors parallel to each other of equal magnitude but **opposite direction**, and separated by a perpendicular distance. These two force vectors are in the **same direction.** 

b) Correct! A couple moment is created when there are two force vectors parallel to each other of equal magnitude but **opposite direction**, and separated by a perpendicular distance.
