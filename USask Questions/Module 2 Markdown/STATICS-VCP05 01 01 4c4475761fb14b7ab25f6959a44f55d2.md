Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}\\\overrightarrow{B}=B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}\\$$

From the options below, select the correct representation of the 2 x 2 matrix needed to calculate the determinant:

a) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}A_x&B_x\\A_y&B_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}B_x&B_y\\A_x&A_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}A_x&A_y\\B_x&B_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}A_x&B_y\\B_x&A_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

# Answer:

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}A_x&A_y\\B_x&B_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ goes in the top row and the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ goes in the bottom row, placing the components left to right.  In this option, the vectors are placed as columns, with their components going from top to bottom. 

b) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ goes in the top row and the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ goes in the bottom row, placing the components left to right.  In this option, the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ was placed on top and the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ was placed on the bottom.

c) Good job! When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ goes in the top row and the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ goes in the bottom row, placing the components left to right. 

d) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ goes in the top row and the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ goes in the bottom row, placing the components left to right.  In this option, the vectors have been placed diagonally instead of across a row.
