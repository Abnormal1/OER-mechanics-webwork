Topic/ Unit: 3. Incorporate couples in moment calculations (CMC)

# Question:

The diagram below shows two force vectors of equal magnitude applied parallel and opposite to each other, at a distance of $d=[A]\,\mathrm{m}$ apart. Calculate the couple moment due to these two vectors using the **scalar formulation**. Report your answer as a whole number, with the appropriate positive or negative sign in front depicting the direction of the moment.

$$M=\_\_\_\_\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}$$

### **Variable Parameters**

$[A]:$ Range (0.1, 0.9), 1 decimal place

# Answer:

$$M=(600*[A])\,\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}$$

# Feedback:

The **scalar formulation** of a couple moment has the form:

$$M=Fd$$

where $M$ is the magnitude of the moment, $F$ is the magnitude of one of the forces creating the couple moment, and $d$ is the perpendicular distance or moment arm between the forces. The sense of the moment is given in the result in the form of a positive (CCW) or negative (CW) sign in front of the answer.
