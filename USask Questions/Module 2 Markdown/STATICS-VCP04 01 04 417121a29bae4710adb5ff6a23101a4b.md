Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane and have the form:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}
\\\overrightarrow{B}=B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}\\$$

Vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ has magnitude $A$ and vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ has magnitude $B$. The angle between the two vectors is denoted by $\theta$. 

From the options below, select the correct representation for the **magnitude** of the cross product of vectors $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$:

a) $|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\sin\theta$

b) $|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=A_xB_x+A_yB_y$

c) $|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\cos\theta$

d) $|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=A_xB_y+A_yB_x$

# Answer:

a) $|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\sin\theta$

# Feedback:

a) Correct! The magnitude of the cross product between two vectors in the $x$-$y$ plane can be found using the **sine** of the angle between them, unlike the dot product, which involves the **cosine** of the angle. 

b) This is actually the magnitude of the **dot product** of $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$. The term-by-term representation of the cross product is derived from finding the determinant of the 2 x 2 matrix created from both vectors. 

c) The expression given in this option is actually the correct representation for a **dot product**. The magnitude of a **cross product** is similar, but uses a different trigonometric function. 

d) The pattern of the terms in this option is correct for the cross product, but when finding the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, you must subtract the second term from the first term.
