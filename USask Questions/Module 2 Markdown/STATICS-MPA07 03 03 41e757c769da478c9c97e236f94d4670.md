Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

Determining the moment about point O in a 3D problem requires taking the cross product between a position vector depicting the moment arm, and the force vector. If each vector is expressed in Cartesian coordinates as such:

$$\overrightarrow{r}=\alpha\hat{i}+\beta\hat{j}+\gamma\hat{k}\\\overrightarrow{F}=U\hat{i}+V\hat{j}+W\hat{k}$$

the select the correct representation of the vector moment calculation:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\r_x&r_y&r_z\\F_x&F_y&F_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(\beta W-\gamma V)-(\alpha W-\gamma U)+(\alpha V-\beta U)$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(\beta W+\gamma V)\hat{i}+(\alpha W+\gamma U)\hat{j}+(\alpha V+\beta U)\hat{k}$

# Answer:

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}$

# Feedback:

a) While this option is technically correct, it is important to respect the variables given in the problem. The vectors in this problem are given with components in $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $U$, $V$, $W$, instead of $r_x$, $r_y$, $r_z$, and $F_x$, $F_y$, $F_z$. The matrix for the determinant should be set up with the variables presented.

b) Correct! The vector moment calculation can be represented by a determinant matrix or the term-by-term expansion of the determinant matrix. The determinant representing the vector formulation of the moment about point O comes from the cross product $\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$. We know that the determinant for the moment vector has three rows: the first made from the unit vectors, the second row is the position vector, and the third row is the force vector, with $xyz$ components placed from left to right. Remember to use the variables given in the problem statement.

c) While the order and pattern of terms in this option is correct, it’s missing the appropriate unit vectors. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

Each term must be multiplied by the proper unit vector.

d) Remember that the determinant of a 2D matrix involves **subtracting** the second product from the first. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

As well, notice the negative sign in front of the $\hat{j}$ term. This negative sign is also missing in the option you’ve selected.
