# Feedback:

a. Note the member is free to rotate about the y-axis at the 3D pin support at $\text{A}$. Thus, $\bold{M_{Ay}}$ should not be there.  All of the other reactions are appropriate though.

b. The member is free to rotate about the y-axis at the 3D pin support $\text{A}$. That is the only degree of freedom for a 3D pin support. There are force reactions in all three directions and moment reactions about the other two axes. 

c. Good job! This is the correct FBD for the member, and you should be able to solve for the cable tension and reactions at $\text{A}$ based on this FBD.

d. The member is free to rotate about the y-axis at the 3D pin support at $\text{A}$. That is the only degree of freedom for a 3D pin support.  There are force reactions in all three directions and moment reactions about the other two axes.
