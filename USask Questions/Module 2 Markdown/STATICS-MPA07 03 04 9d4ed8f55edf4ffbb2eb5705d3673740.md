Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

Determining the moment about point O in a 3D problem requires taking the cross product between a position vector depicting the moment arm, and the force vector. If each vector is expressed in Cartesian coordinates as such:

$$\overrightarrow{r}=\alpha\hat{i}+\beta\hat{j}+\gamma\hat{k}\\\overrightarrow{F}=U\hat{i}+V\hat{j}+W\hat{k}$$

the select the correct representation of the vector moment calculation:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\U&V&W\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\\end{vmatrix}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(\beta W-\gamma V)-(\alpha W-\gamma U)+(\alpha V-\beta U)$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(\beta W-\gamma V)\hat{i}-(\alpha W-\gamma U)\hat{j}+(\alpha V-\beta U)\hat{k}$

# Answer:

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(\beta W-\gamma V)\hat{i}-(\alpha W-\gamma U)\hat{j}+(\alpha V-\beta U)\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) Close! The determinant representing the vector formulation of the moment about point O comes from the cross product $\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$. The determinant in this option depicts the cross product in the wrong order, $\overrightarrow{F}\times\overrightarrow{r}$. In other words, the $\overrightarrow{r}$ and $\overrightarrow{F}$ vectors are in the wrong rows in this option.

---

b) While this option has the correct placement of the $\overrightarrow{r}$ and $\overrightarrow{F}$ vectors, it is missing the first row of unit vectors. Remember that the determinant for the moment vector has three rows: the first made from the unit vectors $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, $\hat{k}$, the second row is the position vector, and the third row is the force vector, with $xyz$ components placed from left to right.

---

c) While the order and pattern of terms in this option is correct, itâ€™s missing the appropriate unit vectors. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

Each term must be multiplied by the proper unit vector.

d) Good job! The vector moment calculation can be represented by a determinant matrix or the term-by-term expansion of the determinant matrix. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

This option shows the correct order of terms! Even though the vectors in this problem are presented with different variables, the pattern remains the same. Remember the negative sign in front of the $\hat{j}$ term in the middle.
