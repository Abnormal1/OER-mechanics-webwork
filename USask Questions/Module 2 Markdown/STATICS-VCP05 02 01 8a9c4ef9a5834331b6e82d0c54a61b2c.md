Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}\\\overrightarrow{B}=B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}\\$$

In order to find the cross product between these two vectors, you must calculate the determinant, which can be set up as:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}A_x&A_y\\B_x&B_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$$

From the options below, select the correct form of the determinant as calculated from the above expression:

a) $\begin{vmatrix}A_x&A_y\\B_x&B_y\\\end{vmatrix}=A_yB_x-A_xB_y$

b) $\begin{vmatrix}A_x&A_y\\B_x&B_y\\\end{vmatrix}=A_xB_y-A_yB_x$

c) $\begin{vmatrix}A_x&A_y\\B_x&B_y\\\end{vmatrix}=A_xB_y+A_yB_x$

d) $\begin{vmatrix}A_x&A_y\\B_x&B_y\\\end{vmatrix}=A_xB_x-A_yB_y$

# Answer:

b) $\begin{vmatrix}A_x&A_y\\B_x&B_y\\\end{vmatrix}=A_xB_y-A_yB_x$

a) When you find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.

The terms in this option have their orders switched!

b) Correct! To find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.

While the order of terms in this option is correct, the sign in the middle is not. Make sure you are subtracting the terms, not adding.

d) When you find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.

The terms in this option resemble the **dot product** expression more than the cross product expression, and do not follow the diagonal pattern shown above.
