Assume you have solved this problem.  The FBD below shows your calculated numerical results without appropriate units attached. From the list below, select the option ****depicting the correct presentation of the **conclusion** with appropriate units in the form: "The reaction on the beam at $\text{C}$ is __________  along the direction of member $\text{DC}$."

# Answer:

a. 11.3 $\text{lb}$

b. 11.3 $\text{kN}$

c. 11.3 $\text{N}$

d. 11.3 $\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$

# Feedback:

a. The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units. While the unit shown in this answer can be used for force, it is not the force unit used in the problem.

b. Good job! The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units. 

c. The force unit used in the problem is "$\text{kN}$". If you wish to report the result in "$\text{N}$", then the numerical value needs to be converted according to $1~\text{kN}=1000~\text{N}$.

d. The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units. $\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$ is the unit for a moment, not for a force.
