Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

Determining the moment about point O in a 3D problem requires taking the cross product between a position vector depicting the moment arm, and the force vector. If each vector is depicted in Cartesian coordinates as such:

$$\overrightarrow{F}=F_x\hat{i}+F_y\hat{j}+F_z\hat{k}\\\overrightarrow{r}=r_x\hat{i}+r_y\hat{j}+r_z\hat{k}$$

then select the correct representation of the determinant expansion of the vector moment calculation:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(r_yF_z-r_zF_y)\hat{i}-(r_xF_z-r_zF_x)\hat{j}+(r_xF_y-r_yF_x)\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(r_yF_z-r_zF_y){i}-(r_xF_z-r_zF_x){j}+(r_xF_y-r_yF_x){k}$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(F_yr_z-F_zr_y)\hat{i}-(F_xr_z-F_zr_x) \hat{j}+(F_xr_y-F_yr_x)\hat{k}$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(r_yF_z+r_zF_y)\hat{i}-(r_xF_z+r_zF_x)\hat{j}+(r_xF_y+r_yF_x)\hat{k}$

# Answer:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(r_yF_z-r_zF_y)\hat{i}-(r_xF_z-r_zF_x)\hat{j}+(r_xF_y-r_yF_x)\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) Well done! Even though the force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$ is stated before the position vector $\overrightarrow{r}$, the order of the determinant doesn't change ($\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$). Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

This option shows the correct order of terms! Remember the negative sign in front of the $\hat{j}$ term in the middle.

b) While the order and pattern of terms in this option is correct, itâ€™s missing the correct vector notation on the unit vectors (hats on top of the variables). Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

Notice how each unit vector has the hat on top (i.e. $\hat{i}$ as opposed to $i$). This vector notation is important for presentation of a vector moment. 

---

c) This option would be correct if the determinant was set up for $\overrightarrow{F}\times\overrightarrow{r}$. However, the moment about a point is always calculated as $\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$. To calculate the correct moment, consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

The y & z components are paired with the $\hat{i}$ term, the x & z components with the $\hat{j}$ term, and the x & y components with the $\hat{k}$ term.

---

d) Close! Remember that calculating the 2D determinant requires **subtracting** the second product from the first, so each sign inside the brackets should be a **negative** sign. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

Also notice the negative sign in front of the $\hat{j}$ term. All the negative signs are important in this expanded representation!
