Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane and have the form:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}
\\\overrightarrow{B}=B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}\\$$

Vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ has magnitude $A$ and vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ has magnitude $B$.  The angle between the two vectors is denoted by $\theta$. 

From the options below, select the correct representation for the mathematical expression of the cross product of vectors $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$:

a) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(AB\cos\theta)\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)$

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{k}$

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(AB\sin\theta)$

# Answer:

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) While it is correct that this result includes the unit vector $\overrightarrow{k}$, the trigonometric term is not quite right. When calculating the **dot product**, we use the cosine between two angles.  When calculating the magnitude of the **cross product**, we use something different. 

b) This option has the correct pattern of terms, but it is presented as a scalar (missing a unit vector). The result of a cross product between two 2D vectors is a vector, and it is directed along the $z$ axis. 

c) Correct!  The term-by-term representation of the cross product between two 2D vectors is $(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)$, and is directed along the $z$ axis, therefore including the unit vector $\hat{k}$.

d) While the expression given in this option is correct, it is only presented as a scalar.  Remember that the result of a cross product is a **vector**. Therefore, the correct answer must include a unit vector.
