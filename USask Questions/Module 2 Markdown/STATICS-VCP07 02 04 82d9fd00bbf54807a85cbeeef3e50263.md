Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 3D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=5\hat{i}+6\hat{j}-2{k}\\\overrightarrow{B}=9\hat{i}+9\hat{k}\\$$

In order to find the cross product between these two vectors, you must calculate the determinant, which can be set up as:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\5&6&-2\\9&0&9\\\end{vmatrix}$$

From the options below, select the correct form of the determinant as calculated from the above expression:

a) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\5&6&-2\\9&0&9\\\end{vmatrix}=(54+0)\hat{i}+(45+18)\hat{j}+(0+54)\hat{k}=54\hat{i}+63\hat{j}+54\hat{k}$

b) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\5&6&-2\\9&0&9\\\end{vmatrix}=(54-0)\hat{i}-(45+18)\hat{j}+(0-54)\hat{k}=54\hat{i}-63\hat{j}-54\hat{k}$

c) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\5&6&-2\\9&0&9\\\end{vmatrix}=(45-0)\hat{i}-(0-18)\hat{j}+(-18+45)\hat{k}=45\hat{i}+18\hat{j}+27\hat{k}$

d) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\5&6&-2\\9&0&9\\\end{vmatrix}=(0-54)\hat{i}-(54-0)\hat{j}+(-18-45)\hat{k}=-54\hat{i}-54\hat{j}-63\hat{k}$

# Answer:

b) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\5&6&-2\\9&0&9\\\end{vmatrix}=(54-0)\hat{i}-(45+18)\hat{j}+(0-54)\hat{k}=54\hat{i}-63\hat{j}-54\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow(s) and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow(s). Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants. 

This option is incorrectly adding all the terms together, instead of correctly subtracting the blue components and the j term.

b) Great job! When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow(s) and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow(s). Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants.

c) When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow(s) and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow(s). Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants. 

This option is incorrectly calculating products in columns rather than diagonally.

d) When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow(s) and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow(s).  Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants. 

This option has the correct scalar components, but they are all mismatched with the incorrect unit vectors.
