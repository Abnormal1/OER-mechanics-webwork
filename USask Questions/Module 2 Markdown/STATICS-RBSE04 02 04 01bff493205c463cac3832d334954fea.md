# Feedback:

a. Good job! This is the correct FBD for the rod, and you should be able to solve for the reactions at each journal bearing support based on this FBD. 

b. It is correct that the reactions at a journal bearing are two force and two couple moment components which act perpendicular to the rod. **However**, the couple moments are generally **not** applied if the journal bearings are properly aligned. The force reactions developed by the bearings are **sufficient** for equilibrium since they prevent the rod from rotating about each of the coordinate axes. 

c. A smooth journal bearing does not provide any resistance in the direction aligned with the rod. Thus, $\bold{A_y}$, $\bold{B_y}$, and $\bold{C_z}$ should not be there. 

d. Two things are wrong with this FBD. First, a smooth journal bearing does not provide any resistance in the direction aligned with the rod. Thus, $\bold{A_y}$, $\bold{B_y}$, and $\bold{C_z}$ should not be there. Next, although it is correct that the reactions at a journal bearing are two force and two couple moment components which act perpendicular to the rod, the couple moments are generally **not** applied if the journal bearings are properly aligned. The force reactions developed by the bearings are **sufficient** for equilibrium since they prevent the rod from rotating about each of the coordinate axes. Thus, those moment reactions should also be removed.
