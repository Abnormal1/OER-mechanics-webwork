Topic/ Unit: 4. Determine unknown forces and moments that will achieve static equilibrium (2D and 3D) for simple rigid bodies (RBSE)

# Question:

From the options below, select the option that **does not** contain all the necessary equations that describe 2D rigid body static equilibrium in terms of **vector** notation: 

---

---

a) $\sum \overrightarrow{M}_A=0$

$\sum \overrightarrow{M}_B=0$

$\sum \overrightarrow{M}_C=0$

*Given that points $A$, $B$, and $C$ do not lie on the same line

---

b) $\sum \overrightarrow{F}_x=0$

$\sum \overrightarrow{M}_A=0$

$\sum \overrightarrow{M}_B=0$

*Given that the line passing through points $A$ and $B$ is not parallel to the $y$ axis

---

c) $\sum \overrightarrow{F}_x=0$

$\sum \overrightarrow{F}_y=0$

$\sum \overrightarrow{M}_A=0$

---

d) $\overrightarrow{F}_x=0$

$\overrightarrow{F}_y=0$

$\overrightarrow{M}_A=0$

---

# Answer:

d) $\overrightarrow{F}_x=0$

$\overrightarrow{F}_y=0$

$\overrightarrow{M}_A=0$

# Feedback:

a) This option contains one of the **correct** combinations of vector equations of equilibrium for a rigid body in 2D. If the sum of all the vector moments about three separate points $A$, $B$, and $C$ equals zero, then the rigid body is experiencing static equilibrium (as long as the points $A$, $B$, and $C$ do not lie on the same line). 

Choose an option that **does not** contain a correct combination of the vector equations required for static equilibrium of a rigid body in 2D.

b) This option contains one of the **correct** combinations of vector equations of equilibrium for a rigid body in 2D. If the sum of all the component force vectors in the $x$ direction equals zero, **and** the sum of all vector moments about two separate points $A$ and $B$ equals zero, then the rigid body is experiencing static equilibrium (as long as the line between points $A$ and $B$ is not parallel to the $y$ axis). 

Choose an option that **does not** contain a correct combination of the vector equations required for static equilibrium of a rigid body in 2D. 

---

c) This option contains one of the **correct** combinations of vector equations of equilibrium for a rigid body in 2D. If the sums of the component force vectors in both the $x$ and $y$ directions equal zero, and the sum of all vector moments about a point $A$ equals zero, then the rigid body is experiencing static equilibrium. 

Choose an option that **does not** contain a correct combination of the vector equations required for static equilibrium of a rigid body in 2D.

d) Well done! While this option **does** show a correct combination of the equilibrium equations for a rigid body in 2D, they are missing the **summation notation** ($\sum$), which is necessary for equilibrium.
