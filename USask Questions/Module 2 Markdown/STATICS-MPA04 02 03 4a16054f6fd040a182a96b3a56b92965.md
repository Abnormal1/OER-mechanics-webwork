Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

From the options below, select a correct representation of the **vector formulation** of the moment of a force about point $O$.  A position vector $\overrightarrow{r}$ goes from point $O$ to point $A$. A force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$ goes through point $A$ with an angle of $\theta$ between $\overrightarrow{F}$ and $\overrightarrow{r}$. 

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(Fr\sin\theta)\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(Fr\cos\theta)\hat{k}$

c) $M_O=Fr\sin\theta$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(Fd\sin\theta)\hat{k}$

# Answer:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(Fr\sin\theta)\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) Correct! The vector formulation of the moment about point $O$ can be represented the same way as a cross product - as the product of the magnitudes of each vector multiplied by the sine of the angle between them. Remember that since this is a cross product, the result must be multiplied by the unit vector $\hat{k}$, since the direction of the moment  from two 2D vectors in the $xy$ plane is along the $z$ axis. 

b) This option uses the trigonometric function used in a **dot product**. The vector formulation of the moment about point $O$ can be represented the same way as a **cross product** - as the product of the magnitudes of each vector multiplied by the **sine** of the angle between them.

c) This is the correct option for the **scalar formulation** of the moment. The **vector formulation** requires that the result must be multiplied by the unit vector $\hat{k}$, since the direction of the moment  from two 2D vectors in the $xy$ plane is along the $z$ axis. 

d) While the general pattern of this option is correct, the specific variable names are not. Recall that $d=r\sin\theta$, so the formula for a moment should not have both $d$ and $\sin\theta$ in the result. This representation of the cross product should include the product of the magnitudes of the force vector, $\overrightarrow{F}$, and the position vector, $\overrightarrow{r}$, all multiplied by the sine of the angle $\theta$.
