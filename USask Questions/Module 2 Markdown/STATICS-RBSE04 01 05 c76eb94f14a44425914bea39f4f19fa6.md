# Feedback:

a. Good job! This is the correct FBD for the member, and you should be able to solve for the reaction forces based on this FBD.

b. "Smooth contact" or "smooth surface" means friction is negligible, so there is no resistance to tangential movement. The only unknown is the reaction force acting perpendicular to the surface at the point of contact. Thus, the direction of the reaction force at **B** is incorrect in this FBD. It should be acting **perpendicular** to the surface. 

c. "Smooth contact" or "smooth surface" means friction is negligible, so there is no resistance to tangential movement. The only unknown is the reaction force acting perpendicular to the surface at the point of contact. In this case, point C is in a bit different situation from point B and C. At C, you can consider the lever to be the surface. So the reaction force should be perpendicular to the lever. 

d."Smooth contact" or "smooth surface" means friction is negligible, so there is no resistance to tangential movement. The only unknown is the reaction force acting perpendicular to the surface at the point of contact. Thus, the direction of the reaction force at **A** is incorrect in this FBD. It should be acting **perpendicular** to the surface.
