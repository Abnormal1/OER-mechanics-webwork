Assume you have solved this problem.  The FBD below shows your calculated values. 

![STATICS-RBSE07%2001%2004%2068a1ed8b83e44b57b55cc9cb359f0adc/Untitled.png](STATICS-RBSE07%2001%2004%2068a1ed8b83e44b57b55cc9cb359f0adc/Untitled.png)

From the list of potential conclusions shown below, select the best conclusion.

# Answer:

a. The moment reaction of the fixed support at $\text{A}$ is 20.2 $\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}\curvearrowleft$, and the horizontal and vertical components of the force reaction at $\text{A}$ are 3.46 $\text{kN}\rightarrow$ and 8.00 $\text{kN}\uparrow$, respectively.

b. The horizontal and vertical components of the force reaction at $\text{A}$ are 3.46 $\text{kN}\rightarrow$ and 8.00 $\text{kN}\uparrow$, respectively.

c.  The components of the support reactions are 3.46 $\text{kN}$, 8.00 $\text{kN}$, and 20.2 $\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$.

d. $\text{A}_\text{x}=3.46 ~\text{kN}\rightarrow$, $\text{A}_\text{y}=8.00 ~\text{kN}\uparrow$, and $\text{M}_\text{A}=20.2 ~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}\curvearrowleft$.

# Feedback:

a. Well done! The conclusion to a problem must provide an informative sentence that answers the original question.  This answer does that, with all necessary specifics. 

b. The moment reaction is missing from this conclusion.

c. In addition to stating the numerical results, you also need to be clear about the **direction**, **location** and **type** of the reactions. 

d. The information in this conclusion is comprehensive and correct.  However, a conclusion to a problem should provide an informative **sentence** that answers the original question.
