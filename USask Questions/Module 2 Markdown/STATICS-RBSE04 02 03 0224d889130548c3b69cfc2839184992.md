# Feedback:

a. The weight vector, cable tension, and reaction at $\text{B}$ are correct in this FBD, but the reactions at $\text{A}$ are incorrect. A ball and socket connection is free to rotate in any direction, so there should not be any moment reactions. 

b. The weight vector, cable tension, and reaction at $\text{B}$ are correct in this FBD, but the reaction at $\text{A}$ is incorrect. For the ball and socket support at $\text{A}$, the reactions are three rectangular force components. The sum of the reaction forces can point in any direction, not likely perpendicular to the surface.  You should represent your reaction forces as component forces in your FBD.

c. Good job! This is the correct FBD for the rod, and you should be able to solve for the cable tension and the reaction forces based on this FBD. 

d. The weight vector and the cable tension are correct in this FBD, but the reaction forces at $\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$ are incorrect. For the ball and socket support at $\text{A}$, the reactions are three rectangular force components. The sum of the reaction forces can point in any direction.  However, you should represent your reaction forces as component forces in your FBD.  Also, rod $\text{AB}$ is **NOT** a two force member. Thus, we can not assume the reaction force is directed along the rod. For the smooth surface contact at B, the reaction force should be perpendicular to the surface.
