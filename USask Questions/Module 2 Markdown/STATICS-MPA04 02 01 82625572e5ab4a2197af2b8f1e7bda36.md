Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

From the options below, select a correct representation of the **vector formulation** of the moment of a force about a point $O$.  The position vector $\overrightarrow{r}$ goes from point $O$ out to the line of action of the force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$.

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$

b) $M_O=r\times F$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}=\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\overrightarrow{F}\times\overrightarrow{r}$

# Answer:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$

# Feedback:

a) Correct!  The vector formulation of a moment $\overrightarrow{M}_O$ about a point $O$ involves finding the cross product between the position vector which is the moment arm, $\overrightarrow{r}$, and the force vector, $\overrightarrow{F}$. Remember, the order matters i.e. $\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}\not=\overrightarrow{F}\times\overrightarrow{r}$.

b) While the order of the symbols here is correct, it is important to include the vector notation (the arrow) on top of each variable. 

c) Close! This option is almost fully correct, but the subscript is missing from the $\overrightarrow{M}$ vector. The subscript is important because it gives information as to which point the moment is about.  Make sure you select an answer that has the correct notation for $\overrightarrow{M}_O$.

d) Almost! It is true that the vector formulation of a moment $\overrightarrow{M}_O$ about a point $O$ involves finding the cross product between the position vector which is the moment arm, $\overrightarrow{r}$, and the force vector, $\overrightarrow{F}$.  However, remember that the order matters i.e. $\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}\not=\overrightarrow{F}\times\overrightarrow{r}$.
