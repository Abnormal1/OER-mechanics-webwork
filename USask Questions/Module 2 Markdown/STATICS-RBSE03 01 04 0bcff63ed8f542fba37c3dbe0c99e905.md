# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

Determine the horizontal and vertical components of reaction at the pin $A$ and the reaction of the rocker $B$ on the beam.

From the list below, select the option that **is not acceptable** as a list of information that you are required to **find** in this problem:

---

---

a) ${A}_x$, ${A}_y$, ${B}_x$, ${B}_y$

---

b) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, the reaction components at pin $A$

$\overrightarrow{R}_B$, the reaction of the rocker $B$

---

c) ${A}_x$ & ${A}_y$, the reaction components at pin $A$

${B}_x$ & ${B}_y$, the reaction components at rocker $B$

---

d) $\overrightarrow{F}_A$, the reaction force at pin $A$

$\overrightarrow{F}_B$, the reaction force at rocker $B$

---

# Answer:

d) $\overrightarrow{F}_A$, the reaction force at pin $A$

$\overrightarrow{F}_B$, the reaction force at rocker $B$

---

# Feedback:

a) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalar components (although they could also be stated as vector components).  Notice that the reaction at $B$ can be found either as as a reaction force $\overrightarrow{R}_B$ or as components ($B_x$, $B_y$), shown here. It is also a good idea to include a word description, though not required. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

---

b) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vector components with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. Notice that the reaction at $B$ can be found either as components ($B_x$, $B_y$) or as a reaction force $\overrightarrow{R}_B$, shown here. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem.

c) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalars with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as vectors. Notice that the reaction at $B$ can be found either as as a reaction force $\overrightarrow{R}_B$ or as components ($B_x$, $B_y$), shown here. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem.

d) Correct! This option **is not acceptable** because the problem asks for the "horizontal and vertical components" of the reaction at pin $A$. Typically, these would be written as $A_x$ and $A_y$ (vector or scalar is fine). The variable $F$ could be used, but the components still need to be labeled separately as $x$ and $y$.
