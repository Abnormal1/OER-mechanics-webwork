Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

From the options below, select the correct representation for the mathematical expression of the cross product of two 3D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, where:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}+A_z\hat{k}
\\\overrightarrow{B}=B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}+B_z\hat{k}\\$$

a) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_yB_z-A_zB_y)-(A_xB_z-A_zB_x)+(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)$

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_yB_z-A_zB_y)\hat{i}-(A_xB_z-A_zB_x)\hat{j}+(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{k}$

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=[(A_yB_z-A_zB_y)-(A_xB_z-A_zB_x)+(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)]\hat{k}$

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_yB_z-A_zB_y)\hat{k}-(A_xB_z-A_zB_x)\hat{j}+(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{i}$

# Answer:

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_yB_z-A_zB_y)\hat{i}-(A_xB_z-A_zB_x)\hat{j}+(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) While the pattern of the $xyz$ components within the brackets is correct in this option, there are no unit vectors. Remember that the result of a cross product is a **vector**, so each term in brackets should be multiplied by a specific unit vector.  

b) Correct! The determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix containing $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$ is written out term-by-term in this form. Notice the pattern of $xyz$ components, the subtractions inside each bracketed term, and the signs of the $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$ terms. 

c) While the pattern of the $xyz$ components within the brackets is correct in this option, the unit vectors are not correct.  When we take the cross product of two 2D vectors, the result is in the $z$ direction (with a $\hat{k}$ term), but the cross product of two 3D vectors will have components in all three dimensions and will have $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$ terms. 

d) While the pattern of the $xyz$ components within the brackets is correct in this option, the unit vectors are not correct. They should appear in the standard order of $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$.
