Topic/ Unit: 4. Determine unknown forces and moments that will achieve static equilibrium (2D and 3D) for simple rigid bodies (RBSE)

# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

The uniform plate below has a weight of $500\,\mathrm{lb}$. Determine the tensions in each of the supporting cables.

From the list below, select the option with all the correct information that is **given** in the above problem:

---

---

a) A uniform plate suspended by ropes supporting a downward force

See diagram for dimensions

$\overrightarrow{W}_{\mathrm{plate}}=(-500\,\mathrm{lb})\hat{k}$

$\overrightarrow{F}=(-200\,\mathrm{lb})\hat{k}$

Coordinate axes as shown

---

b) A uniform plate suspended by ropes supporting a downward force

See diagram for dimensions

$\overrightarrow{W}_{\mathrm{plate}}=(500\,\mathrm{lb})\hat{k}$

$\overrightarrow{F}=(200\,\mathrm{lb})\hat{k}$

Coordinate axes as shown

---

c) A uniform plate

See diagram for dimensions

$\overrightarrow{W}_{\mathrm{plate}}=(-500\,\mathrm{lb})\hat{k}$

$\overrightarrow{F}=(-200\,\mathrm{lb})\hat{k}$

Coordinate axes as shown

---

d) A uniform plate suspended by ropes supporting a downward force

$\overrightarrow{W}_{\mathrm{plate}}=(-500\,\mathrm{lb})\hat{k}$

$\overrightarrow{F}=(-200\,\mathrm{lb})\hat{k}$

Coordinate axes as shown

# Answer:

a) A uniform plate suspended by ropes supporting a downward force

See diagram for dimensions

$\overrightarrow{W}_{\mathrm{plate}}=(-500\,\mathrm{lb})\hat{k}$

$\overrightarrow{F}=(-200\,\mathrm{lb})\hat{k}$

Coordinate axes as shown

# Feedback:

a) Correct! This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly. The values for the weight of the plate and the additional downward force are stated properly, and the coordinate axes are referenced. This is all the information "given" in this problem.

b) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly, as well as referencing the coordinate axes. The values for the weight of the plate and the additional downward force are notated properly, but the signs are not correct. For the coordinate system shown in the problem, the forces should be in the $-z$ direction. 

c) This option refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly, and the values for the weight of the plate and the additional downward force are stated properly. The coordinate axes are also referenced appropriately. However, the descriptive sentence is lacking information. When providing a description, try to include all the components of the scenario that are relevant.

d) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and the values for the weight of the plate and the additional downward force are stated properly. The coordinate axes are also referenced appropriately. However, something is missing that refers to the dimensions of the plate in the problem.
