Topic/ Unit: 4. Determine unknown forces and moments that will achieve static equilibrium (2D and 3D) for simple rigid bodies (RBSE)

# Question:

From the options below, select the option that **does contain** the correct combination of equations that describe 3D rigid body static equilibrium in terms of **scalar** notation: 

---

---

a)

$\begin{matrix}\sum F_x=0&\sum M_x=0\\\sum F_y=0&\sum M_y=0\\\sum F_z=0&\sum M_z=0\\\end{matrix}$

---

b)

$\begin{matrix}\sum F_x=0&\\\sum F_y=0&\\\sum F_z=0&\\\end{matrix}$

---

c)

$\begin{matrix}\sum F_x&\sum M_x\\\sum F_y&\sum M_y\\\sum F_z&\sum M_z\\\end{matrix}$

---

d)

$\begin{matrix}\sum \overrightarrow{F}_x=0&\sum \overrightarrow{M}_x=0\\\sum \overrightarrow{F}_y=0&\sum \overrightarrow{M}_y=0\\\sum \overrightarrow{F}_z=0&\sum \overrightarrow{M}_z=0\\\end{matrix}$

# Answer:

a)

$\begin{matrix}\sum F_x=0&\sum M_x=0\\\sum F_y=0&\sum M_y=0\\\sum F_z=0&\sum M_z=0\\\end{matrix}$

# Feedback:

a) Well done! If the sums of the scalar force components in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions equal zero, **and** the sum of all scalar moments about each $x$, $y$, and $z$ axis equal zero, then the rigid body is experiencing static equilibrium in 3D.

b) This option is half correct. The force equations are correct here, but it is missing the similar arrangement of moment equations. For static equilibrium of a rigid body in 3D, all the forces **and moments** in each direction must add up to zero. 

c) This option has the correct arrangement of variables, but is missing the right side of the equations. It is important to clearly state each time that the sum of all variables **equals zero**. If it does not equal zero, it is not in equilibrium. 

d) Close! This option is actually a correct combination of equations for equilibrium in 3D written in **vector** notation. This question is asking for the equations of equilibrium in **scalar** notation.
