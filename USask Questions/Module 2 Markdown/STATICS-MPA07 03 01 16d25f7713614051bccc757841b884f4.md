Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

Determining the moment about point O in a 3D problem requires taking the cross product between a position vector depicting the moment arm, and the force vector. If each vector is expressed in Cartesian coordinates as such:

$$\overrightarrow{r}=r_x\hat{i}+r_y\hat{j}+r_z\hat{k}\\\overrightarrow{F}=F_x\hat{i}+F_y\hat{j}+F_z\hat{k}$$

the select the correct representation of the vector moment calculation:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(r_xF_y-r_yF_x)\hat{i}-(r_yF_z-r_zF_y) \hat{j}+(r_xF_z-r_zF_x)\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\F_x&F_y&F_z\\r_x&r_y&r_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(r_yF_z-r_zF_y)\hat{i}+(r_xF_z-r_zF_x)\hat{j}+(r_xF_y-r_yF_x)\hat{k}$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\r_x&r_y&r_z\\F_x&F_y&F_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

# Answer:

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\r_x&r_y&r_z\\F_x&F_y&F_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

# Feedback:

a) While the pattern of terms within the brackets is correct for this term-by-term representation, their order is not. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2003%2001%2016d25f7713614051bccc757841b884f4/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2003%2001%2016d25f7713614051bccc757841b884f4/Untitled.png)

The y & z components are paired with the $\hat{i}$ term, the x & z components with the $\hat{j}$ term, and the x & y components with the $\hat{k}$ term.

b) While the vector moment calculation can be represented by a determinant matrix or the term-by-term expansion, this determinant matrix has not been set up correctly. The cross product is constructed in the wrong order, $\overrightarrow{F}\times\overrightarrow{r}$. In other words, the $\overrightarrow{r}$ and $\overrightarrow{F}$ vectors are in the wrong rows in this option.

---

c) This option shows the term-by-term representation of the vector moment, and is almost correct. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2003%2001%2016d25f7713614051bccc757841b884f4/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2003%2001%2016d25f7713614051bccc757841b884f4/Untitled.png)

Notice the negative sign in front of the $\hat{j}$ term. This negative sign is missing in the option youâ€™ve selected.

---

d) Correct! The vector moment calculation can be represented by a determinant matrix or the term-by-term expansion of the determinant matrix. This determinant has been set up correctly to represent $\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$: the first row is made from the unit vectors, the second row is the position vector $\overrightarrow{r}$, and the third row is the force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$.
