Which of the following notations can be used to represent the magnitude of the tension in the cable? (Select all that apply)

# Answer:

a. $\bold{T}$

b. $\text{T}$

c. $\overrightarrow{T}$

d. $|\overrightarrow{T}|$

# Feedback:

### Answer specific feedback:

a. This is a vector notation. The magnitude of a force is a scalar. See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

b. Good job! This is one of the correct answers. See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

c. This is a vector notation. The magnitude of a force is a scalar. See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

d. Good job! This is one of the correct answers. See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

### General feedback:

It is common to confuse vector notation with scalar notation. Note the following accepted notations for both:

$$\mathrm{vector}:\overrightarrow{A}\;\mathrm{or}\;\bold{A}$$

$$\mathrm{scalar}:|\overrightarrow{A}|\;\mathrm{or}\;\text{A}$$

Scalar values are typically represented with a simple variable symbol, e.g. $\text{A}$, but can be represented as the magnitude of a vector, e.g. $|\overrightarrow{A}|$.
