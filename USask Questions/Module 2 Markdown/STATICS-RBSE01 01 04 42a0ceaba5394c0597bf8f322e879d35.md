# Answer:

a. Particle

b. Rigid body

# Feedback:

a. Particles and rigid bodies are two idealized models we can use in mechanics in order to simplify application of the theory. A particle has a mass, but a size that can be neglected. This generally requires all the forces acting on a body to converge to the centre of gravity of the body. In this case, the support reactions provided by the man's hands and head do **not** meet at the centre of gravity of the object. Thus, it **cannot** be considered to be a **particle**. However, the deformation of the object is likely to be small. Thus, it can be considered to be a **rigid body**.

b. Well done!  Particles and rigid bodies are two idealized models we can use in mechanics in order to simplify application of the theory. A particle has a mass, but a size that can be neglected. This generally requires all the forces acting on a body to converge to the centre of gravity of the body. In this case, the support reactions provided by the man's hands and head do **not** meet at the centre of gravity of the object. Thus, it **cannot** be considered to be a **particle**.
