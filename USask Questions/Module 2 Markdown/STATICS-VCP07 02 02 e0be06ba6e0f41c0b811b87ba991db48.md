Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 3D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=\alpha\hat{i}+\beta\hat{j}+\gamma{k}\\\overrightarrow{B}=U\hat{i}+V\hat{j}+W\hat{k}\\$$

In order to find the cross product between these two vectors, you must calculate the determinant, which can be set up as:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}$$

From the options below, select the correct form of the determinant as calculated from the above expression:

a) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}=(\beta W+\gamma V)\hat{i}+(\alpha W+\gamma U)\hat{j}+(\alpha V+\beta U)\hat{k}$

b) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}=(\beta W-\gamma V)-(\alpha W-\gamma U)+(\alpha V-\beta U)$

c) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}=(\beta W-\gamma V)\hat{i}-(\alpha W-\gamma U)\hat{j}+(\alpha V-\beta U)\hat{k}$

d) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}=\alpha U\hat{i}+\beta V\hat{k}+\gamma W\hat{k}$

# Answer:

c) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\\alpha&\beta&\gamma\\U&V&W\\\end{vmatrix}=(\beta W-\gamma V)\hat{i}-(\alpha W-\gamma U)\hat{j}+(\alpha V-\beta U)\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow(s) and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow(s).  Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants. 

This pattern is the same even if other variable names are used that are different than the standard $A_x$, $A_y$, etc. 

In this option, the order of the terms is correct, but the signs are not. Make sure you have the appropriate negative signs in your answer.

b) When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow(s) and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow(s).  Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants. 

This pattern is the same even if other variable names are used that are different than the standard $A_x$, $A_y$, etc. 

This option is missing the unit vectors in the result. Make sure each unit vector is multiplied to its correct term.

c) Great job! When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow(s) and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow(s).  Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants. 

This pattern is the same even if other variable names are used that are different than the standard $A_x$, $A_y$, etc.

d) When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow(s) and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow(s).  Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants. 

This pattern is the same even if other variable names are used that are different than the standard $A_x$, $A_y$, etc. 

In this option, the components are (incorrectly) products of the elements in each column.  Make sure you follow the pattern above to calculate the proper determinant.
