Assume you have solved this problem.  The FBD below shows your calculated numerical results without appropriate units attached. From the list below, select the option ****depicting the correct presentation of the **conclusion** with appropriate units in the form: "The tension in the cable is __________."

# Answer:

a. 74.6 $\text{lb}$

b. 74.6 $\text{N}$

c. 74.6 $\text{lb}\cdot\text{ft}$

# Feedback:

a. Good job! The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units. 

b. The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units. While the unit shown in this answer can be used for force, it is not the force unit used in the problem.

c. The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units. $\text{lb}\cdot\text{ft}$ is the unit for a moment, not for a tension force.
