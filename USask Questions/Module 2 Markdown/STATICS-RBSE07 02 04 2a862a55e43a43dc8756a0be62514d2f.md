Assume you have solved this problem.  The FBD below shows your calculated values. If this question requires you to round your final results to three sig figs, select the best presentation of the conclusion in the form "The horizontal and vertical components of the reaction force of the fixed support at $\text{A}$ are __________ $\text{kN}$ and ________ $\text{kN}$, respectively." from the list below.

# Answer:

a. 3.4641, 8

b. 3.46, 8.00

c. 3.46, 8

d. 3, 8

# Feedback:

a. Both the horizontal and the vertical components of the reaction force are not reported to three sig figs. If the numerical result has more than three sig figs, first, you need to determine which digit is the third significant figure. Then look at one digit to the right of that digit and round accordingly. If the numerical result has less than three sig figs, you can add trailing zeros after the decimal point. 

b. Well done! The numerical results are reported to three sig figs correctly.

c. The vertical component of the reaction force only has one sig fig in this option.  If the numerical result has less than three sig figs, you can add trailing zeros after the decimal point. 

d. The numerical results are reported to only one sig fig in this answer. If the numerical result has more than three sig figs, first, you need to determine which digit is the third significant figure. Then look at one digit to the right of that digit and round accordingly. If the numerical result has less than three sig figs, you can add trailing zeros after the decimal point.
