Topic/ Unit: 3. Incorporate couples in moment calculations (CMC)

# Question:

In the diagram below, there are two couples. The two force vectors in red, $\overrightarrow{F}_1$ and $\overrightarrow{F}_2$, create one couple moment. What is the **sense** of the couple moment created by the force vectors in red?

a) CW

b) CCW

# Answer:

a) CW

# Feedback:

a) Well done! If you imagine pulling on the direction of each of the red vectors in the diagram, the frame will have a tendency to rotate in the clockwise (CW) sense. 

b) Try to imagine pulling on the direction of each of the red vectors in the diagram, and seeing which sense the frame would have a tendency to rotate in.
