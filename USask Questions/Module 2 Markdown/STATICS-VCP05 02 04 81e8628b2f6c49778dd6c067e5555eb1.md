Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=9\hat{i}+4{j}\\\overrightarrow{B}=2\hat{j}\\$$

In order to find the cross product between these two vectors, you must calculate the determinant, which can be set up as:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}9&4\\0&2\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$$

From the options below, select the correct form of the determinant as calculated from the above expression:

a) $\begin{vmatrix}9&4\\0&2\\\end{vmatrix}=(9)(4)-(0)(2)=36$

b) $\begin{vmatrix}9&4\\0&2\\\end{vmatrix}=(9)(2)+(4)(0)=18$

c) $\begin{vmatrix}9&4\\0&2\\\end{vmatrix}=(9)(4)(0)(2)=0$

d) $\begin{vmatrix}9&4\\0&2\\\end{vmatrix}=(9)(2)-(4)(0)=18$

# Answer:

d) $\begin{vmatrix}9&4\\0&2\\\end{vmatrix}=(9)(2)-(4)(0)=18$

# Feedback:

a) When you find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.

Notice that "missing" terms in the original vectors are represented by a coefficient of zero in the correct spot. 

This option presents the terms as if they were multiplied across each row, instead of diagonally.

b) When you find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.

Notice that "missing" terms in the original vectors are represented by a coefficient of zero in the correct spot. 

This option has the correct pattern of terms, but the incorrect sign in the middle. The result is unaffected, because the second term is zero, but the sign must be written correctly regardless.

c) To find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.

Notice that "missing" terms in the original vectors are represented by a coefficient of zero in the correct spot. 

This option multiplies all the terms in the matrix together, instead of finding one product diagonally and subtracting the second diagonal product from it.

d) Correct! When you find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.
