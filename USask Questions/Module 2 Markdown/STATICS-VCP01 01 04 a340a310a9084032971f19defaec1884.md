a. Good job! The cross pross product of two vectors $\overrightarrow{B}$ and $\overrightarrow{A}$ yields a third vector, $\overrightarrow{C}$.  The direction of $\overrightarrow{C}$ is determine by the right hand rule; i.e. curling the fingers of the right hand from the first vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ to the second vector $\overrightarrow{A}$, then the thumb points in the direction of their cross product, which is into the page in this case.

The direction of $\overrightarrow{C}$ is determine by the right hand rule; i.e. curling the fingers of the right hand from the first vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ to the second vector $\overrightarrow{A}$, then the thumb points in the direction of their cross product, which is into the page in this case. 

c. The cross pross product of two vectors $\overrightarrow{B}$ and $\overrightarrow{A}$ yields a third vector, $\overrightarrow{C}$.  In general,  $\overrightarrow{C}$ should always be perpendicular to the plane containing $\overrightarrow{B}$ and $\overrightarrow{A}$. The specific direction of $\overrightarrow{C}$ is determine by the right hand rule; i.e. curling the fingers of the right hand from the first vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ to the second vector $\overrightarrow{A}$, then the thumb points in the direction of their cross product, which is into the page in this case.
