Topic/ Unit: 4. Determine unknown forces and moments that will achieve static equilibrium (2D and 3D) for simple rigid bodies (RBSE)

# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

The smooth uniform rod $AB$ is supported by a ball-and-socket joint at $A$, the wall at $B$, and cable $BC$. Determine the components of reaction at $A$, the tension in the cable, and the normal reaction at $B$ if the rod has a mass of $20\,\mathrm{kg}$.

From the list below, select the option that **is not acceptable** as a list of information that you are required to **find** in this problem:  

---

a) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$, $\overrightarrow{A}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_z$, the components of reaction at $A$

$\overrightarrow{B}_x$, the normal reaction at point $B$

$\overrightarrow{T}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{T}_z$, the tension in the cable

---

b) ${A}_x$, ${A}_y$ & ${A}_z$, the components of reaction at $A$

${B}_x$, the normal reaction at point $B$

 ${T}_y$ & ${T}_z$, the tension in the cable

---

c) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$, $\overrightarrow{A}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_z$, $\overrightarrow{T}_x$, $\overrightarrow{T}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{T}_z$

---

d) $\overrightarrow{A}$, the reaction at $A$

$\overrightarrow{B}_x$, the normal reaction at point $B$

$\overrightarrow{T}$, the tension in the cable

---

# Answer:

c) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$, $\overrightarrow{A}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_z$, $\overrightarrow{T}_x$, $\overrightarrow{T}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{T}_z$

# Feedback:

a) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vectors with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as scalars. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

b) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalars (though they could also be stated as vectors) with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

c) Good job! This option **is not acceptable** because it's missing the variable for the normal reaction at point $B$ and it includes $\overrightarrow{T}_x$, when there is no x component to the cable's tension.  It is also a good idea to include a word description, though not required. 

d) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vectors with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include.  Note that it is not necessary to state each vector component separately (i.e. $\overrightarrow{A}_x$, $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, etc.), although that would be a good idea just so you can remind yourself of which components you need to solve for. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem.
