Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

The diagram below depicts a force vector of 600 lb being applied to a strut. The strut will want to rotate counter-clockwise as a result of the force. If the magnitude of the moment about point $O$ is 2298 lbâˆ™ft, select the correct vector representation of the moment.

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{2298\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}\}\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{-2298\,\mathrm{lb\cdot ft}\}\hat{k}$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{2298\,\mathrm{lb\cdot ft}\}\hat{j}$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{2298\,\mathrm{lb\cdot ft}\}\hat{k}$

# Answer:

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{2298\,\mathrm{lb\cdot ft}\}\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) The units in this option are incorrect. Notice that the values in the question are stated in $\mathrm{lb\cdot ft}$, not $\mathrm{N\cdot m}$. Otherwise the unit vector notation is correct! In this 2D problem, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$.

b) The sign in this option is incorrect. Because the sense of the moment is counter-clockwise, the sign of the value should be positive. Otherwise the unit vector notation is correct! In this 2D problem, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$.

c) This option is has an incorrect unit vector. In a 2D problem like this, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$. Because the sense of the moment is counter-clockwise, the sign of the value is positive, which is correctly stated here.

d) Well done! In this 2D problem, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$. Because the sense of the moment is counter-clockwise, the sign of the value is positive. Remember to always report your answer with correct units!
