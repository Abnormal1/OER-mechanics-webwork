# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

Due to an unequal distribution of fuel in the wing tanks, the centers of gravity for the airplane fuselage $A$ and wings $B$ and $C$ are located as shown. If these components have weights $W_A=45,000\,\mathrm{lb}$, $W_B=8000\,\mathrm{lb}$, and $W_C=6000\,\mathrm{lb}$, determine the normal reactions of the wheels $D$, $E$, and $F$ on the ground.

# Answer:

b) An airplane with an unequal distribution of fuel

Dimensions as shown

$W_A=45,000\,\mathrm{lb}$

$W_B=8000\,\mathrm{lb}$

$W_C=6000\,\mathrm{lb}$

Coordinate axes as shown

# Feedback:

a) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly. The three values for the given weights are also stated properly. However, there is a set of coordinate axes clearly shown in the diagram, and those should be referenced. Choose an answer that refers to these axes. 

b) Correct! This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly. The three values for the given weights are stated properly, and the coordinate axes are referenced. This is all the information "given" in this problem.

c) This option refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly, and the three values for the given weights are stated correctly. The coordinate axes are also referenced. However, the descriptive sentence is missing. Every list of "given" information should start with a short description of the problem that includes all the relevant components.  

d) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly, as well as referencing the coordinate axes. However, the values for weight are not stated properly. They are missing units, which is an important part of the complete value.
