# Answer:

a. Particle

b. Rigid body

# Feedback:

a. Good job! Particles and rigid bodies are two idealized models we can use in mechanics in order to simplify application of the theory. A particle has a mass, but a size that can be neglected. This generally requires all the forces acting on a body to converge to the centre of gravity of the body. In this case, the suspended weight is subjected to two forces, its own weight and the cable tension, both of which go through its centre of gravity. Thus, it can be considered to be a particle.
