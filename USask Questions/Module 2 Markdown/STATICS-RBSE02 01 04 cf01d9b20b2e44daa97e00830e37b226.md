Topic/ Unit: 4. Determine unknown forces and moments that will achieve static equilibrium (2D and 3D) for simple rigid bodies (RBSE)

# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

Determine the horizontal and vertical components of reaction at the pin $A$ and the reaction of the rocker $B$ on the beam.

From the list below, select the option with all the correct information that is **given** in the above problem:

---

a) A beam supported by a pin and a rocker

See diagram for dimensions & angles

$\theta=30^\circ$

$\overrightarrow{F}=-4\hat{j}\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

b) A beam supported by a pin and a rocker

See diagram for dimensions & angles

$\overrightarrow{F}=-4\hat{j}\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

c) A pin and a rocker

See diagram for dimensions & angles

$\overrightarrow{F}=-4\hat{j}\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

d) A beam supported by a pin and a rocker

See diagram for dimensions & angles

$\overrightarrow{F}=-4\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

# Answer:

b) A beam supported by a pin and a rocker

See diagram for dimensions & angles

$\overrightarrow{F}=-4\hat{j}\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

# Feedback:

a) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions and angles in the diagram properly. The force value is also stated correctly. However, there is an extra value stated that is not necessary. Because of the line "See diagram for dimensions & angles", it is not necessary to explicitly state the angle $\theta=30^\circ$ again in the "given" information. 

b) Correct! This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions and angles in the diagram properly. The force value is stated appropriately, as a negative value in the $\hat{j}$ direction. Note that a scalar representation of the force value would be accepted as well (i.e. $F=4\,\mathrm{kN}$). This is all the information "given" in this problem.

c) This option refers to the dimensions and angles in the diagram properly, and states the relevant force values as magnitudes correctly. However, the descriptive sentence is not complete. When providing a description, try to include all the components of the scenario that are relevant. 

d) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions and angles in the diagram properly. However, the force value is not stated correctly. Because the variable is written with a vector symbol, $\overrightarrow{F}$, the value must be written with a corresponding unit vector, in this case, $\hat{j}$. Another correction could be to state the variable as a scalar, and not include the unit vector.
