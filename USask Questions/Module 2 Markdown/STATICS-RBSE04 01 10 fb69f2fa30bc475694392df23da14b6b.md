# Feedback:

a. There are three unknows associated with a fixed support. The reactions are the couple moment and the two force components. 

b. There are three unknows associated with a fixed support. The reactions are the couple moment and the two force components.

c. There are three unknows associated with a fixed support. The reactions are the couple moment and the two force components.

d. Good job! This is the correct FBD for the member, and you should be able to solve for the reaction forces based on this FBD.
