Topic/ Unit: 4. Determine unknown forces and moments that will achieve static equilibrium (2D and 3D) for simple rigid bodies (RBSE)

# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

The truss is supported by a pin at $A$ and a roller at $B$. Determine the support reactions.

From the list below, select the option with all the correct information that is **given** in the above problem:

---

---

a) A truss supported by a pin and a roller

See diagram for dimensions & angles

$|\overrightarrow{F}_1|=5\,\mathrm{kN}$

$|\overrightarrow{F}_2|=10\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

b) A truss

See diagram for dimensions & angles

$|\overrightarrow{F}_1|=5\,\mathrm{kN}$

$|\overrightarrow{F}_2|=10\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

c) A truss supported by a pin and a roller

See diagram for dimensions & angles

$\overrightarrow{F}_1=5\,\mathrm{kN}$

$\overrightarrow{F}_2=10\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

d) A truss supported by a pin and a roller

See diagram for dimensions

$|\overrightarrow{F}_1|=5\,\mathrm{kN}$

$|\overrightarrow{F}_2|=10\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

# Answer:

a) A truss is supported by a pin at one point and a roller at the other

See diagram for dimensions & angles

$|\overrightarrow{F}_1|=5\,\mathrm{kN}$

$|\overrightarrow{F}_2|=10\,\mathrm{kN}$

# Feedback:

a) Correct! This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions and angles in the diagram properly. Both force values are stated as magnitudes, since we are not given the Cartestian vector information for the first force, $5\,\mathrm{kN}$. Note that it would also be acceptable to write $F_1=5\,\mathrm{kN}$ and $F_2=10\,\mathrm{kN}$ without the magnitude notation. This is all the information "given" in this problem.

b) This option refers to the dimensions and angles in the diagram properly, and states the relevant force values as magnitudes correctly. However, the descriptive sentence is not complete. When providing a description, try to include all the components of the scenario that are relevant. 

c) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions and angles in the diagram properly. However, the force variables are not written with the correct notation. While the forces are vectors in the diagram, the values are given and stated as magnitudes, so the notation should match. Using magnitude notation such as $|\overrightarrow{F}|$ or scalar notation such as $F$ are both acceptable. 

d) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and the force values are stated correctly. However, the line about dimensions is incomplete. There are dimensions of length in the diagram as well as angles that will be necessary for calculation. Therefore the sentence here should read "See diagram for dimensions **& angles**".
