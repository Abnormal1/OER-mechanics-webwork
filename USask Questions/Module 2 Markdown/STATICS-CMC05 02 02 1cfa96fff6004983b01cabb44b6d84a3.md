# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

If two couples produce a moment with the same magnitude and direction, then these two couples are equivalent. In this question, both couples cause a tendency of CCW rotation. However, the couple on the left hand side has a moment of $|\overrightarrow{M}|=100~\text{N}~(3 ~\text{m})= 300~\text{N}\cdot\text{m}$. The couple on the right hand side has a moment of $|\overrightarrow{M}|=60~\text{N}~(6 ~\text{m})= 360~\text{N}\cdot\text{m}$. Thus, the two couples presented in this question are **NOT** equivalent.
