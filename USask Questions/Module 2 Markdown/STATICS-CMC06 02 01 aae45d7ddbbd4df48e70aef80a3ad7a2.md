# Answer:

4

# Feedback:

Since these couples are equivalent, they must produce a moment with the same magnitude and direction.  We can see that both couples cause a tendency of CCW rotation, and the magnitude of the moment produced by these two couples can be calculated from the diagrams as: 

$$ |\overrightarrow{M}|=50~\text{N}~(6 ~\text{m})=75~\text{N}~(d ~\text{m})= 300~\text{N}\cdot\text{m}$$

Solving for $d$ in the right hand diagram, 

$$d=\frac{300~\text{N}\cdot\text{m}}{75~\text{N}}=4~\text{m}$$
