Assume you have solved this problem.  The FBD below shows your calculated values. If this question requires you to round your final results to three sig figs, select the best presentation of the conclusion in the form of "The reaction on the beam at $\text{C}$ is __________ $\text{kN}$ in the direction of member $\text{DC}$." from the list below the FBD.

# Answer:

a. 11.3137

b. 11.31

c. 11.3

d. 11

# Feedback:

a. This answer has six sig figs. To round a number to three significant figures, first, you need to determine which digit is the third significant figure. In this case, the third significant figure is on the tenths place. Then look at one digit to the right of the tenths place and round accordingly.

b. This answer has four sig figs. To round a number to three significant figures, first, you need to determine which digit is the third significant figure. In this case, the third significant figure is on the tenths place. Then look at one digit to the right of the tenths place and round accordingly.

c. Well done! This answer is rounded to three sig figs correctly.

d. This answer only has two sig figs. To round a number to three significant figures, first, you need to determine which digit is the third significant figure. In this case, the third significant figure is in the tenths place. Then look at one digit to the right of the tenths place and round accordingly.
