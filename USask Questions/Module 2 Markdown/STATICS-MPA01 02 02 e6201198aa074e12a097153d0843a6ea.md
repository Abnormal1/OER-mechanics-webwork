Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

Indicate the correct **sense** of the moment generated by the force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$ about point $O$ in the diagram below:

a) Clockwise (CW)

b) Counter-clockwise (CCW)

# Answer:

a) Clockwise (CW)

# Feedback:

a) Correct! The **sense** of a moment can be determined by logically imagining how the applied force might rotate the object around the point in question.  Since this is a rotational movement, we describe it using the words "clockwise" or "counter-clockwise". For example, the image shown below depicts a moment with a counter-clockwise (CCW) sense.

This option was the incorrect sense of the moment - try again!
