# Answer:

a. Particle

b. Rigid body

# Feedback:

a. Particles and rigid bodies are two idealized models we can use in mechanics in order to simplify application of the theory. A particle has a mass, but a size that can be neglected. This generally requires all the forces acting on a body to converge to the centre of gravity of the body.  A rigid body has dimensions and it assumes the body's shape does not change when a load is applied.  In this case, all the forces acting on member AB do **not** meet at its centre of gravity, so it should **not** be considered as a particle. However, the deformation of member AB is likely to be small. Thus, it can be considered to be a rigid body.

b. Well done! Particles and rigid bodies are two idealized models we can use in mechanics in order to simplify application of the theory. A particle has a mass, but a size that can be neglected. This generally requires all the forces acting on a body to converge to the centre of gravity of the body.  A rigid body has dimensions and it assumes the body's shape does not change when a load is applied.
