Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane and have the form:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}
\\\overrightarrow{B}=B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}\\$$

From the options below, select the correct representation for the mathematical expression of the cross product of vectors $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$:

a) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_xB_y)\hat{i}-(A_yB_x)\hat{j}$

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=A_xB_y-A_yB_x$

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=A_xB_x+A_yB_y$

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{k}$

# Answer:

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) The pattern of scalar terms in this option is correct, but not the arrangement of the unit vectors. While the result of a cross product of two 2D vectors is a vector, it must be directed along the $z$ axis. 

b) This option has the correct pattern of terms, but it is missing a unit vector. The result of a cross product of two 2D vectors is a vector, and it is directed along the $z$ axis. 

c) This is the correct representation for the **dot product**, which is a scalar. The result of a cross product is a **vector**, and the pattern of terms is different than that of a dot product. 

d) Correct!  The term-by-term representation of the cross product between two 2D vectors is$(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)$, and is directed along the $z$ axis, therefore including the unit vector $\hat{k}$.
