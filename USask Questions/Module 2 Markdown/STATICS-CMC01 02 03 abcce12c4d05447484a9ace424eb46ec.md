# Question:

In the diagram below, do the two force vectors $\overrightarrow{F}_1$ and $\overrightarrow{F}_2$ create a couple moment?  The magnitudes of the two vectors are the same value.

a) Yes

b) No

# Answer:

a) Yes

# Feedback:

a) Correct! A couple moment is created when there are two force vectors parallel to each other of equal magnitude but opposite direction, separated by a perpendicular distance. 

b) A couple moment is created when there are two force vectors parallel to each other of equal magnitude but opposite direction, separated by a perpendicular distance. The vectors in this diagram meet all the requirements for a couple moment.
