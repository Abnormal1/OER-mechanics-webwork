Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane and have the form:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}
\\\overrightarrow{B}=B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}\\$$

Vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ has magnitude $A$ and vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ has magnitude $B$. The angle between the two vectors is denoted by $\theta$. 

From the options below, select the correct representation for the mathematical expression of the cross product between vectors $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$:

a) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(AB\sin\theta)$

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_xB_x+A_yB_y)\hat{k}$

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)$

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(AB\sin\theta)\hat{k}$

# Answer:

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(AB\sin\theta)\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) While the expression given in this option is correct, remember that the result of a cross product is a **vector**. Therefore, the correct answer must include a unit vector. 

b) While this answer is presented as a vector in the correct direction, the pattern of terms here is actually correct for the **dot product**, not the cross product. 

c) The term-by-term representation of the cross product between two 2D vectors, $(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)$, is correct but the result of a **cross product** is a vector.  Therefore, the correct answer must include a unit vector.

d) Correct! The magnitude of the cross product between two vectors in the $x$-$y$ plane can be found using the **sine** of the angle between them, unlike the dot product, which involves the **cosine** of the angle.  Also, the result of a cross product is a **vector**, not a scalar, and therefore we need to include the unit vector $\overrightarrow{k}$ for the cross product between two 2D vectors.
