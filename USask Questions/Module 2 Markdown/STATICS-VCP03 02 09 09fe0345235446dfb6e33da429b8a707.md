Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

 What is the direction of the unit vector cross product  $\hat{k}\times\hat{k}$?

# Answer

a. $\hat{k}$

b.  $\hat{i}$

c. N/A, because $\hat{k}\times\hat{k}=0$

d. $\hat{j}$

### Answer Specific Feedback:

a. The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0.

b. The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0.

c. Well done! The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0.

d. The cross product is maximized when the two vectors are perpendicular and minimized when they are aligned. In this case, the two vectors are aligned, so their cross product is 0.
