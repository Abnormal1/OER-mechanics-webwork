Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane. Vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ has magnitude $A$ and vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ has magnitude $B$. The angle between the two vectors is denoted by $\theta$. 

From the options below, select the correct representation for the **magnitude** of the cross product between vectors $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$:

a) $|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\tan\theta$

b) $|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\sin\theta$

c) $|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB$

d) $|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\cos\theta$

# Answer:

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=AB\sin\theta$

# Feedback:

a) While the general formula in this option is correct, the trigonometric term is not quite right. We don't use tangent to calculate either the cross product or the dot product of two vectors.

b) Correct! The magnitude of the cross product between two vectors in the $x$-$y$ plane can be found using the **sine** of the angle between them, unlike the dot product, which involves the **cosine** of the angle. 

c) In order to find the cross product or the dot product between two vectors, we must find either the sine (cross product) or the cosine (dot product) of the angle between them as well as the product of their magnitudes. 

d) The expression given in this option is actually the correct representation for a **dot product**. The magnitude of a **cross product** is similar, but uses a different trigonometric function.
