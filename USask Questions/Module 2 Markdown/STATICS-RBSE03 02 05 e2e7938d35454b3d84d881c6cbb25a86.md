Topic/ Unit: 4. Determine unknown forces and moments that will achieve static equilibrium (2D and 3D) for simple rigid bodies (RBSE)

# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

The rod is supported by smooth journal bearings at $A$, $B$, and $C$ and is subjected to the two forces shown.  Determine the reactions at these supports.

From the list below, select the option that **is not acceptable** as a list of information that you are required to **find** in this problem:  

---

a) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$, $\overrightarrow{A}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_z$, the components of reaction at $A$

$\overrightarrow{B}_x$, $\overrightarrow{B}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{B}_z$, the components of reaction at $B$

$\overrightarrow{C}_x$, $\overrightarrow{C}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{C}_z$, the components of reaction at $C$

---

b) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_z$, the components of reaction at $A$

$\overrightarrow{B}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{B}_z$, the components of reaction at $B$

$\overrightarrow{C}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{C}_y$, the components of reaction at $C$

---

c) $\overrightarrow{A}$, $\overrightarrow{B}$, $\overrightarrow{C}$, the reaction vectors at $A$, $B$, and $C$

---

d) ${A}_x$ & ${A}_z$, the components of reaction at $A$

${B}_x$ & ${B}_z$, the components of reaction at $B$

${C}_x$ & ${C}_y$, the components of reaction at $C$

---

# Answer:

a) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$, $\overrightarrow{A}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_z$, the components of reaction at $A$

$\overrightarrow{B}_x$, $\overrightarrow{B}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{B}_z$, the components of reaction at $B$

$\overrightarrow{C}_x$, $\overrightarrow{C}_y$ & $\overrightarrow{C}_z$, the components of reaction at $C$

# Feedback:

a) Correct! This option **is not acceptable** because it's including all the components for reactions at each point. Because the journal bearings are smooth, they are only limiting the rod's movement in two directions each, depending on their orientation. Note that these components can be stated as scalars as well. 

b) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vectors with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as scalars. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

c) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vectors with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include.  Note that it is not necessary to state each vector component separately (i.e. $\overrightarrow{A}_x$, $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, etc.), although that would be a good idea just so you can remind yourself of which components you need to solve for. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

d) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalars (though they could also be stated as vectors) with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem.
