From the list below, select the option with all the correct information that is **given** in the above problem:

---

a) A bent bar positioned between two ledges and pulled down

See diagram for dimensions & angles

${F}=250\,\mathrm{N}$

---

b) A bent bar

See diagram for dimensions & angles

${F}=250\,\mathrm{N}$

---

c) A bent bar positioned between two ledges and pulled down

See diagram for dimensions

${F}=250\,\mathrm{N}$

---

d) A bent bar positioned between two ledges and pulled down

See diagram for dimensions & angles

$250\,\mathrm{N}$

---

# Answer:

a) A bent bar positioned between two ledges and pulled down

See diagram for dimensions & angles

${F}=250\,\mathrm{N}$

# Feedback:

a) Correct! This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions and angles in the diagram properly. The force value is stated appropriately, as a scalar value, since that's what is given in the problem. A vector value should not be used since the components would need to be calculated. This is all the information "given" in this problem.

b) This option refers to the dimensions and angles in the diagram properly, and states the relevant force value as a magnitude correctly. However, the descriptive sentence is not complete. When providing a description, try to include all the components of the scenario that are relevant. 

c) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and the force value is stated properly. The line about dimensions and angles, however, is incomplete. When referring to dimensions or angles in a diagram, you must use the complete phrase "dimensions and angles **as shown**", or "**see diagram for** dimensions and angles".

d) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions and angles in the diagram properly. However, the force value is not stated correctly. Make sure that you assign a variable to every value given in a problem (other than the dimensions of the diagram) so that you can easily use it in your calculations. While any variable name is technically correct, it is a good idea to use commonly acceptable ones, such as $F$ for forces, $W$ for weight, and $m$ for mass.
