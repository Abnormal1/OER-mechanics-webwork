Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=-3{i}+6\hat{j}\\\overrightarrow{B}=7\hat{i}\\$$

From the options below, select the correct representation of the 2 x 2 matrix needed to calculate the determinant:

a) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}-3&6\\7\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}-3&6\\7&0\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}3&6\\7&0\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}7&0\\-3&6\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

# Answer:

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}-3&6\\7&0\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right. This option only has three numbers in the matrix, and there must be four for a 2 x 2 matrix determinant. The "missing" term in the $\overrightarrow{B}$ vector still needs a number placeholder.

b) Correct! When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right. Notice the negative sign is retained in the $A_x$ term, and the "missing" term in the $\overrightarrow{B}$ row is actually a 0.

c) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right. This option has all the correct numbers, but is missing a negative sign on the $A_x$ component. 

d) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right. This option has all the correct numbers, but they've been arranged with the $\overrightarrow{B}$ vector on top and the $\overrightarrow{A}$ vector on the bottom.
