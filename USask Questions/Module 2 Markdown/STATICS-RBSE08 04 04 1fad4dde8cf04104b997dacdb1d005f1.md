# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

A three-force member has forces applied at three points on the member ... and that's all.  In this case, two things are wrong.  First, forces are only applied at two points (A and B).  Second, besides the reaction forces applied at the two supports, there is a moment applied at the top right corner of the member. Thus, this member is **NOT** a three-force member.
