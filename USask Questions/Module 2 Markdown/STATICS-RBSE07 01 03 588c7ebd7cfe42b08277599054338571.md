Assume you have solved this problem.  The FBD below shows your calculated values. 

![STATICS-RBSE07%2001%2003%20588c7ebd7cfe42b08277599054338571/Untitled.png](STATICS-RBSE07%2001%2003%20588c7ebd7cfe42b08277599054338571/Untitled.png)

From the list of potential conclusions shown below, select the best conclusion.

# Answer:

a. $\text{A}_\text{x}=-3.54 ~\text{kN}$, $\text{A}_\text{y}=5.49 ~\text{kN}$, and $\text{B}_\text{y}=8.05 ~\text{kN}$.

b. The components of reaction at the pin $\text{A}$ are -3.54 $\text{kN}$ and 5.49 $\text{kN}$, and the reaction of the roller $\text{B}$ is 8.05 $\text{kN}$. 

c. The reaction forces are  3.54 $\text{kN}\leftarrow$, 5.49 $\text{kN}\uparrow$, and 8.05 $\text{kN}\uparrow$, respectively.

d. The horizontal and vertical components of reaction at the pin $\text{A}$ are 3.54 $\text{kN}\leftarrow$ and 5.49 $\text{kN}\uparrow$, respectively, and the reaction at the roller $\text{B}$ is 8.05 $\text{kN}$ directed upwards. 

# Feedback:

a. The information in this conclusion is comprehensive and correct.  However, a conclusion to a problem should provide an informative **sentence** that answers the original question.

b. In addition to stating the numerical results, you also need to be clear about which answers belong to which component reaction forces i.e. which ones are x and y components. 

c. In addition to stating the numerical results, you also need to be clear about the direction and **location** of the forces. 

d. Well done! The conclusion to a problem must provide an informative sentence that answers the original question.  This answer does that, with all necessary specifics.
