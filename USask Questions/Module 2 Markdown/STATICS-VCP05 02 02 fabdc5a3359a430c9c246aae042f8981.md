Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=\alpha\hat{i}+\beta\hat{j}\\\overrightarrow{B}=\gamma\hat{i}+\delta\hat{j}\\$$

In order to find the cross product between these two vectors, you must calculate the determinant, which can be set up as:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\alpha&\beta\\\gamma&\delta\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$$

From the options below, select the correct form of the determinant as calculated from the above expression:

a) $\begin{vmatrix}\alpha&\beta\\\gamma&\delta\\\end{vmatrix}=\alpha\delta+\beta\gamma$

b) $\begin{vmatrix}\alpha&\beta\\\gamma&\delta\\\end{vmatrix}=\alpha\beta-\gamma\delta$

c) $\begin{vmatrix}\alpha&\beta\\\gamma&\delta\\\end{vmatrix}=\alpha\delta-\beta\gamma$

d) $\begin{vmatrix}\alpha&\beta\\\gamma&\delta\\\end{vmatrix}=\alpha\gamma-\beta\delta$

# Answer:

c) $\begin{vmatrix}\alpha&\beta\\\gamma&\delta\\\end{vmatrix}=\alpha\delta-\beta\gamma$

# Feedback:

a) When you find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.

This pattern is the same even if other variable names are used that are different than the standard $A_x$, $A_y$, etc. 

While the order of terms in this option is correct, the sign in the middle is not. Make sure you are subtracting the terms, not adding.

b) When you find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.

This pattern is the same even if other variable names are used that are different than the standard $A_x$, $A_y$, etc. 

This option presents the terms as if they had been multiplied across each row instead of diagonally.

c) Correct! To find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.

This pattern is the same even if other variable names are used that are different than the standard $A_x$, $A_y$, etc. 

This options presents the terms as if they had been multiplied down each column instead of diagonally.
