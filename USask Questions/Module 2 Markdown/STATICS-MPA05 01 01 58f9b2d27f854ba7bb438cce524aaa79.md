Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

The diagram below depicts a force vector of 50 N being applied to a bent pipe. The pipe will want to rotate clockwise as a result of the force. If the magnitude of the moment about point $O$ is 37.5 Nâˆ™m, select the correct vector representation of the moment.

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{37.5\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}\}\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{-37.5\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}\}\hat{j}$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{-37.5\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}\}$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{-37.5\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}\}\hat{k}$

# Answer:

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\{-37.5\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}\}\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) The sign in this option is incorrect. Because the sense of the moment is clockwise, the sign of the value is negative. Otherwise the unit vector notation is correct! In this 2D problem, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$.

b) This option has an incorrect unit vector. In a 2D problem like this, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$. Because the sense of the moment is clockwise, the sign of the value is negative, which is correctly stated here.

c) This option is missing a unit vector. In a 2D problem like this, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$. Because the sense of the moment is clockwise, the sign of the value is negative, which is correctly stated here.

d) Well done! In this 2D problem, the force vector and the moment arm are both in the xy plane, so the cross product between them results in a vector along the z axis, reported using the unit vector $\hat{k}$. Because the sense of the moment is clockwise, the sign of the value is negative. Remember to always report your answer with correct units!
