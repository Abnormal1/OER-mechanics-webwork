# Feedback:

a. Good job! This is the correct FBD for the member, and you should be able to solve for the reaction forces based on this FBD.

b. The weight of the rod is missing in this FBD. If the mass or weight of the member is not mentioned in the question, then the member can usually be assumed to be weightless. However, since it is mentioned that the mass of the rod is 40 $\text{kg}$, we have to calculate the weight from the given mass and show it on the FBD.

c. The rod is pin connected to the smooth collar. A pin support is usually free to rotate i.e. it is frictionless. Thus, there should not be a moment applied at A.

d. The collar is free to slide along the smooth rod. Thus, there is no resistance in the tangential direction of movement along the rod. The only unknown should be the reaction force acting perpendicular to the rod.
