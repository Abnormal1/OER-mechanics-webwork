Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 3D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=[A]\hat{i}+[B]\hat{j}+[C]\hat{k}\\\overrightarrow{B}=[D]\hat{i}+[E]\hat{j}+[F]\hat{k}\\$$

Calculate the magnitude of the cross product between the two vectors, such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\,\_\_\_\_\,\hat{i}-\,\_\_\_\_\,\hat{j}+\,\_\_\_\_\,\hat{k}$$

Input your answers as natural numbers (no decimal places), with a negative sign as needed. 

### Variable Parameters

$[A]:$ Range (-9, 9), 0 decimal places

$[B]:$ Range (-9, 9), 0 decimal places

$[C]:$ Range (-9, 9), 0 decimal places

$[D]:$ Range (-9, 9), 0 decimal places

$[E]:$ Range (-9, 9), 0 decimal places

$[F]:$ Range (-9, 9), 0 decimal places

# Answer:

$$x\,\,\mathrm{component}=[B][F]-[C][E]$$

$$y\,\,\mathrm{component}=[A][F]-[C][D]$$

$$z\,\,\mathrm{component}=[A][E]-[B][D]$$

# Feedback:

To calculate the cross product between two 3D vectors, you must calculate the determinant of the 3 x 3 matrix constructed from their components. First, construct the 3 x 3 matrix:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\A_x&A_y&A_z\\B_x&B_y&B_z\\\end{vmatrix}$$

To calculate the determinant, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP08%2001%2001%2074267ab2ac574bf0aaa551e1765774eb/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP08%2001%2001%2074267ab2ac574bf0aaa551e1765774eb/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow. Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants. 

The formulaic result to this procedure can be written explicitly as:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(A_yB_z-A_zB_y)\hat{i}-(A_xB_z-A_zB_x)\hat{j}+(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{k}$$

This formula can be used directly to substitute in the appropriate components and find the magnitude of the cross product as the value inside the brackets.
