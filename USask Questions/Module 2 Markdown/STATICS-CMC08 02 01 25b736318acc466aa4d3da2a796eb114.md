# Question:

Determine the x and y components of the resultant force and the resultant couple moment for the equivalent force couple at point O. Express the sense of the moment with a + or - sign in front of your answer, where + is for CCW and - is for CW.

Resultant force at point O: $\{$____$\hat{i}+$____$\hat{j}\} \text{~N}$

Resultant couple moment at point O: ________ $\text{N}\cdot\text{m}$

# Answer:

$0,~-500$

$-1000$

# Feedback:

A system of forces and moments acting on a body can be replaced with an equivalent system consisting of a single resultant force acting at a specific point and a resultant couple moment.  This is called an equivalent force couple. 

In this question, for example, we can attach a pair of equal but opposite forces to the pin at point $O$, as shown in the figure below.  We can then rearrange how we look at the 3 force vectors in the diagram.  The $500~\text{N}$ force downwards at point $A$ and the $500~\text{N}$ force upwards at point $O$ together form a couple that produces a couple moment $\curvearrowleft+M=-500 ~\text{N}~(2~\text{m})=-1000~\text{N}\cdot\text{m}$.  Then we are left with a $500~\text{N}$ force acting downwards at point $O$.  This final result is shown in the diagram on the right.

The procedure can be further simplified as follows: when a force is moved to another point P that is not on its line of action, it will create the same external effects on the body if a couple moment is also applied to the body. The couple moment is determined by taking the moment of the force about point P.
