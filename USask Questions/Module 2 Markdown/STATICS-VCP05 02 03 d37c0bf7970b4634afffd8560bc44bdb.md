Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=-6\hat{i}+\hat{j}\\\overrightarrow{B}=2\hat{i}+5\hat{j}\\$$

In order to find the cross product between these two vectors, you must calculate the determinant, which can be set up as:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}-6&1\\2&5\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$$

From the options below, select the correct form of the determinant as calculated from the above expression:

a) $\begin{vmatrix}-6&1\\2&5\\\end{vmatrix}=(-6)(5)-(1)(2)=-32$

b) $\begin{vmatrix}-6&1\\2&5\\\end{vmatrix}=(-6)(1)-(2)(5)=-16$

c) $\begin{vmatrix}-6&1\\2&5\\\end{vmatrix}=(-6)(2)-(1)(5)=-17$

d) $\begin{vmatrix}-6&1\\2&5\\\end{vmatrix}=(-6)(5)+(1)(2)=-28$

# Answer:

a) $\begin{vmatrix}-6&1\\2&5\\\end{vmatrix}=(-6)(5)-(1)(2)=-32$

# Feedback:

a) Correct! When you find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.

This option presents the terms as if they had been multiplied across each row instead of diagonally.

This option presents the terms as if they had been multiplied down each column instead of diagonally.

d) When you find the determinant of a 2 x 2 matrix, find the first product starting at the top left, then subtract the second product starting from the top right.

This option has the correct pattern of numbers, but the sign in the middle is incorrect. Make sure you subtract the second product from the first.
