Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

From the options below, select the correct representation for the determinant form of the cross product of two 3D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, where:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}+A_z\hat{k}
\\\overrightarrow{B}=B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}+B_z\hat{k}\\$$

a) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}\\A_x&A_y\\B_z&B_y\\\end{vmatrix}$

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\B_x&B_y&B_z\\A_z&A_y&A_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}A_x&A_y&A_z\\B_z&B_y&B_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\A_x&A_y&A_z\\B_x&B_y&B_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

# Answer:

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\A_x&A_y&A_z\\B_x&B_y&B_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

# Feedback:

a) While the general pattern here is correct, this matrix is missing some components. When finding the determinant for the cross product of two 3D vectors, you must arrange a 3 x 3 matrix with their components. 

b) While the first row of unit vectors is correct, the next two rows are out of order. Make sure that the order of vectors in the rows matches the order in the cross product on the left hand side of the equation. 

c) While the placement of the two vectors is correct here, the determinant is missing the top row of unit vectors. 

d) Correct! The determinant representation the cross product between two 3D vectors consists of three rows: the first of unit vectors, the second of the first vector, $\overrightarrow{A}$, and the third of the second vector, $\overrightarrow{B}$. The $xyz$ components are placed left to right.
