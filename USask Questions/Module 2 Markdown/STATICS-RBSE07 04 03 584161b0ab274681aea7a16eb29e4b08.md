Which of the following notations can be used to represent the reaction force **vector** at $\text{B}$? (Select all that apply)

# Answer:

a. $\bold{N_{B}}$

b. $\bold{T_{B}}$

c. $\overrightarrow{N}_\text{B}$

d. $\overrightarrow{M}_\text{B}$

# Feedback:

### Answer specific feedback:

a. Good job! This is one of the correct answers. See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

b. The reaction provided by a roller support is a normal force, thus, it is generally represented by the letter **N**. **T** is usually used for tensions in cables, ropes and chains. 

c. Good job! This is one of the correct answers. See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

d. The reaction provided by a roller support is a normal force, thus, it is generally represented by the letter **N**. **M** is usually used for moments. 

### General feedback:

It is common to confuse vector notation with scalar notation. Note the following accepted notations for both:

$$\mathrm{vector}:\overrightarrow{A}\;\mathrm{or}\;\bold{A}$$

$$\mathrm{scalar}:|\overrightarrow{A}|\;\mathrm{or}\;\text{A}$$

Vector values are typically represented by a bolded letter, $\bold{A}$, or with an arrow on top, $\overrightarrow{A}$.
