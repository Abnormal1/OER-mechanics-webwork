# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

Determine the tension in the cable and the horizontal and vertical components of reaction at pin $A$. The pulley at $D$ is frictionless and the cylinder weighs $80\,\mathrm{lb}$.

From the list below, select the option that **is not acceptable** as a list of information that you are required to **find** in this problem:

---

---

a) $T$, the tension in the cable

${A}_x$ & ${A}_y$, the reaction components at pin $A$

---

b) $T, A_x,$ and $A_y$

---

c) $T$, the tension in the cable

$A$, the reaction at pin $A$

---

d) $\overrightarrow{T}$, the tension in the cable

$\overrightarrow{A}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, the reaction components at pin $A$

---

# Answer:

c) $T$, the tension in the cable

$A$, the reaction at pin $A$

# Feedback:

a) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalars with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as vectors. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

b) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalars (though they could also be stated as vectors). It is also a good idea to include a word description, though not required. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

c) Correct! This option **is not acceptable** because the problem specifically asks for the horizontal and vertical components of the reaction at pin $A$. These need to be written separately as $A_x$ and $A_y$, not just $A$. Otherwise, the general set-up of this answer is correct. 

d) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vectors with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as scalars. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem.
