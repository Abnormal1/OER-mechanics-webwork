From the list below, select the option that **is not acceptable** as a list of information that you are required to **find** in this problem:

---

---

a) ${A}_y$, ${B}_y$, $C_x$ & ${C}_y$, the reaction components at points $A$, $B$, and $C$

---

b) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, the reaction component at point $A$

$\overrightarrow{B}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{B}_y$, the reaction component at point $B$

$\overrightarrow{C}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{C}_y$, the reaction component at point $C$

---

c) ${A}_y$, the reaction component at point $A$

${B}_y$, the reaction component at point $B$

$C_x$ & ${C}_y$, the reaction components at point $C$

---

d) $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, the reaction component at point $A$

$\overrightarrow{B}_y$, the reaction component at point $B$

$\overrightarrow{C}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{C}_y$, the reaction components at point $C$

---

# Answer:

b) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, the reaction component at point $A$

$\overrightarrow{B}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{B}_y$, the reaction component at point $B$

$\overrightarrow{C}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{C}_y$, the reaction component at point $C$

# Feedback:

a) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalar components with an additional word description to match, even though the four variables are combined in one line. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as vectors. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

---

b) Correct! This option **is not acceptable** because there will not be any horizontal reaction components at points $A$ or $B$. These reactions will occur normal to the surface, in a purely vertical direction. The reaction at point $C$ will have both $x$ and $y$ components due to its angle. Also note that the word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include, and it is also acceptable to state the variables as scalars.
