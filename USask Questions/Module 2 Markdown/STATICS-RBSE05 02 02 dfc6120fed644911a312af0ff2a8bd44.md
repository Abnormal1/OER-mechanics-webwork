Topic/ Unit: 4. Determine unknown forces and moments that will achieve static equilibrium (2D and 3D) for simple rigid bodies (RBSE)

# Question:

From the options below, select the one that **does not** contain all the necessary equations that describe 2D rigid body static equilibrium in terms of **scalar** notation: 

---

---

a) $\sum F_x=0$

$\sum M_A=0$

$\sum M_B=0$

*Given that the line passing through points $A$ and $B$ is not parallel to the $y$ axis

---

b) $\sum M_x=0$

$\sum M_y=0$

$\sum M_z=0$

---

c) $\sum M_A=0$

$\sum M_B=0$

$\sum M_C=0$

*Given that points $A$, $B$, and $C$ do not lie on the same line

---

d) $\sum F_x=0$

$\sum F_y=0$

$\sum M_A=0$

---

# Answer:

b) $\sum M_x=0$

$\sum M_y=0$

$\sum M_z=0$

# Feedback:

a) This option contains one of the **correct** combinations of scalar equations of equilibrium for a rigid body in 2D. If the sum of all the scalar force components in the $x$ direction equals zero, **and** the sum of all scalar moments about two separate points $A$ and $B$ equals zero, then the rigid body is experiencing static equilibrium (as long as the line between points $A$ and $B$ is not parallel to the $y$ axis). 

Choose an option that **does not** contain a correct combination of the scalar equations required for static equilibrium of a rigid body in 2D.

b) Well done! While this option seems similar to one of the correct combinations including all three moments, notice the subscripts on the $M$ variables. The sum of scalar moments about three separate **points** $A$, $B$, and $C$ must equal zero, but each of these moments is parallel with the $z$ axis when we work with 2D problems. Therefore, we do not want to depict our moment variables as $M_x$, $M_y$, and $M_z$.

c) This option contains one of the **correct** combinations of scalar equations of equilibrium for a rigid body in 2D.  If the sum of all the scalar moments about three separate points $A$, $B$, and $C$ equals zero, then the rigid body is experiencing static equilibrium (as long as the points $A$, $B$, and $C$ do not lie on the same line).

d) This option contains one of the **correct** combinations of scalar equations of equilibrium for a rigid body in 2D. If the sum of all the scalar force components in the $x$ direction and the $y$ direction equal zero **separately**, and the sum of all scalar moments about a point equals zero, then the rigid body is experiencing static equilibrium. 

Choose an option that **does not** contain a correct combination of the scalar equations required for static equilibrium of a rigid body in 2D.
