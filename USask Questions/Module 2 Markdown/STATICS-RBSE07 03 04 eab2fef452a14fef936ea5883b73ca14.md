Assume you have solved this problem.  The FBD below shows your calculated results without appropriate units attached. From the list below, select the option ****depicting the correct presentation of the **conclusion** with appropriate units in the form: "The moment reaction of the fixed support $\text{A}$ is __________ CCW."

# Answer:

a. 20.2 $\text{lb}\cdot\text{ft}$

b. 20.2 $\text{kN}$

c. 20.2 $\text{N}\cdot\text{m}$

d. 20.2 $\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$

# Feedback:

a. The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units. The question is using the SI unit system, while this answer is using the US Customary unit system.

b. The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units.  $\text{kN}$ is the unit for a force, not for a moment. 

c. The units shown in the FBD include $\text{kN}$ and $\text{m}$.  So this answer should be in $\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$.  If you wish to report the result in $\text{N}\cdot\text{m}$, then the numerical value needs to be converted according to $1~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}=1000~\text{N}\cdot\text{m}$

d. Well done! The conclusion to a problem must be given with appropriate units.
