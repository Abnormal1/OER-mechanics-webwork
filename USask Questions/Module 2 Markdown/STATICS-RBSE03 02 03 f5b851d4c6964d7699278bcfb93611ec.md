# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

Due to an unequal distribution of fuel in the wing tanks, the centers of gravity for the airplane fuselage $A$ and wings $B$ and $C$ are located as shown. If these components have weights $W_A=45,000\,\mathrm{lb}$, $W_B=8000\,\mathrm{lb}$, and $W_C=6000\,\mathrm{lb}$, determine the normal reactions of the wheels $D$, $E$, and $F$ on the ground.

From the list below, select the option that **is not acceptable** as a list of information that you are required to **find** in this problem:  

---

a) $D_x$, $D_y$, & $D_z$, the reaction components at point $D$

$E_x$, $E_y$, & $E_z$, the reaction components at point $E$

$F_x$, $F_y$, & $F_z$ the reaction components at point $F$

---

b) $D_z$, the vertical reaction at point $D$

$E_z$, the vertical reaction at point $E$

$F_z$, the vertical reaction at point $F$

---

c) $D_z$, $E_z$, & $F_z$, the vertical reactions at points $D$, $E$, and $F$

---

d) $\overrightarrow{D}_z$, the vertical reaction at point $D$

$\overrightarrow{E}_z$, the vertical reaction at point $E$

$\overrightarrow{F}_z$, the vertical reaction at point $F$

---

# Answer:

a) $D_x$, $D_y$, & $D_z$, the reaction components at point $D$

$E_x$, $E_y$, & $E_z$, the reaction components at point $E$

$F_x$, $F_y$, & $F_z$ the reaction components at point $F$

# Feedback:

a) Good job! This option **is not acceptable** because wheels only have a normal reaction component, so we only need to find the vertical components, $D_z$, $E_z$ &  $F_z$.

b) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalars (though they could also be stated as vectors) with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

c) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalars with an additional word description to match, even though the three variables are combined in one line. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as vectors. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

d) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vectors with an additional word description to match.
