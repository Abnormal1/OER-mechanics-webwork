# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

The $50\,\mathrm{lb}$ mulching machine has a center of gravity at $G$. Determine the vertical reactions at the wheels $C$ and $B$ and the smooth contact point $A$.

From the list below, select the option that **is not acceptable** as a list of information that you are required to **find** in this problem:  

---

a) $B_z$, $C_z$, & $A_z$ 

---

b) $\overrightarrow{C}_z$, the vertical reaction at point $C$

$\overrightarrow{B}_z$, the vertical reaction at point $B$

$\overrightarrow{A}_z$, the vertical reaction at point $A$

---

c) $\overrightarrow{B}_z$ & $\overrightarrow{C}_z$, the vertical reactions at point $B$ and $C$

$\overrightarrow{A}_z$, the reaction at point $A$

---

d) $C$, the vertical reaction at point $C$

$B$, the vertical reaction at point $B$

$A$, the reaction at point $A$

---

# Answer:

d) $C$, the vertical reaction at point $C$

$B$, the vertical reaction at point $B$

$A$, the reaction at point $A$

# Feedback:

a) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalars (though they could also be stated as vectors). It is also a good idea to include a word description, though not required. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

b) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vectors with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as scalars. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

c) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vectors with an additional word description to match, even though two variables are combined in one line. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as scalars. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

d) Good job! This option **is not acceptable** because the problem specifically asks for the vertical components of the reactions at points $B$ and $C$, and the reaction at point $A$. The variables chosen should have the appropriate subscripts written with them i.e. $A_z$, $B_z$, and $C_z$ to indicate that they are the vertical components.
