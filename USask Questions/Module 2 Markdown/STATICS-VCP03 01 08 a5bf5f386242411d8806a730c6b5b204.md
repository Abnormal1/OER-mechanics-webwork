### Answer Specific Feedback:

c. The direction of the cross product of two vectors is specified by the right-hand rule. In this case, the fingers of the right hand curl from $\hat{k}$ to $\hat{j}$, then the thumb is pointing in the negative $\hat{i}$ direction, as shown in the figure below.

b. In general, the cross product of two vectors should always be perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors. Its specific direction can be determined by the right-hand rule, as shown in the figure below.

d. Well done! According to the right-hand rule, $\hat{k}\times\hat{j}=-\hat{i}$. See the figure below. 

a. In general, the cross product of two vectors should always be perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors. Its specific direction can be determined by the right-hand rule, as shown in the figure below.
