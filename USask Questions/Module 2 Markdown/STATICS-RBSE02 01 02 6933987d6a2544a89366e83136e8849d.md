From the list below, select the option with all the correct information that is **given** in the above problem:

---

---

a) Dimensions as shown

Downward force, $F=4\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

b) A beam attached to the wall supported by a strut

Dimensions as shown

---

c) A beam attached to the wall supported by a strut

Dimensions

Downward force, $F=4\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

d) A beam attached to the wall supported by a strut

Dimensions as shown

Downward force, $F=4\,\mathrm{kN}$

---

# Answer:

d) A beam attached to the wall supported by a strut

Dimensions as shown

Downward force, $F=4\,\mathrm{kN}$

# Feedback:

a) This option is missing a descriptive sentence of the scenario. When providing a description, try to include all the components of the scenario that are relevant. 

b) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly. However, there is one more piece of information given on the diagram that must be included. 

c) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the downward force from the diagram properly. However, the line about dimensions is incomplete. When referring to dimensions or angles in a diagram, you must use the complete phrase "dimensions and angles **as shown**", or "**see diagram for** dimensions and angles".

d) Correct! This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly. The value for the downward force depicted in the diagram is also stated clearly. This is all the information "given" in this problem.
