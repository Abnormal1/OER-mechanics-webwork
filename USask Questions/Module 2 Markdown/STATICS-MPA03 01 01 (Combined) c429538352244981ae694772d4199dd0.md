# Feedback:

In this question, the force $\overrightarrow{F}$ is not perpendicular to the rod, thus, one **CANNOT** use $l$ directly as the moment arm to calculate the moment in $|\overrightarrow{M}|=|\overrightarrow{F}| l$

Three different scalar methods can be used to solve this problem:

1. set x and y axes parallel and perpendicular to the **force's** axis, and then find the perpendicular distance from O to the line of action of the force.  Then you can use $|\overrightarrow{M}|=|\overrightarrow{F}| d$  
2. set x and y axes parallel and perpendicular to the **rod's** axis, and then $|\overrightarrow{M}|= F_yd$ , where d is the length of the rod, and $F_y$ is the component of $\overrightarrow{F}$ that is perpendicular to the rod.
3. use the universal set of x and y axes (up/down, left/right) and decompose the force into $F_x$ and $F_y$, and the rod's length into $d_x$ and $d_y$.  Then use the formula $|\overrightarrow{M}|=F_yd_x-F_xd_y$  (just be careful about the sign of the result).  In this example, for instance, you should get a negative result i.e. a CW rotation, as a result of $F_y$ being a negative value (since $F_y$ points down).

**Part a)**

In part a), the axes are set based on the force's axis. Therefore, we can decompose the length of the rod to find the moment arm which is the perpendicular distance from point O to the line of action of the force.

$$d=([B]~\text{m})sin(75^\circ)=[D]~\text{m}$$

Considering counterclockwise moments as positive, and applying the principle of moments, we have

$$\curvearrowleft+|\overrightarrow{M}|=-|\overrightarrow{F}| d=-([A]~\text{kN})([D]~\text{m})=-[M]~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m} $$

Thus, the answer to this question is $[M]~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$, CW or -  $[M]~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$.

**Part b)**

In part b), the axes are set based on the rod's axis. Therefore, we can decompose the force into its x and y components. Here, $F_x$ produces no moment about point O since its line of action passes through this point. Therefore,

$$F_y=([A] ~\text{kN})\sin(75^\circ)=[Y]~\text{kN}$$

Considering counterclockwise moments as positive, and applying the principle of moments, we have

$$\curvearrowleft+|\overrightarrow{M}|=-F_y l=-([Y]~\text{kN})([B]~\text{m})=-[M]~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m} $$

Thus, the answer to this question is $[M]~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$, CW or -  $[M]~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$.

**Part c)**

In part c), use the universal set of x and y axes (up/down, left/right) and decompose the force into $F_x$ and $F_y$, and the rod's length into $d_x$ and $d_y$.  

$$d_x=([B]~\text{m})\cos(30^\circ)=[U]~\text{m}$$

$$d_y=([B]~\text{m})\sin(30^\circ)=[V]~\text{m}$$

$$F_x=([A]~\text{kN})\cos(45^\circ)=[E]~\text{kN}$$

$$F_y=-([A]~\text{kN})\sin(45^\circ)=-[F]~\text{kN}$$

Then use the formula $|\overrightarrow{M}|=F_yd_x-F_xd_y$. This formula considers CCW rotation as positive and can be used consistently as long as you substitute the parameters with correct signs. For example, $F_y$  is pointing down in this case. Combined with a positive moment arm $d_x$, it causes a CW rotation about point O. So when you substitute a negative $F_y$ and a positive $d_x$ into the formula, the result is negative, which indicates the force $F_y$ yields a CW rotation. 

$$\curvearrowleft+|\overrightarrow{M}|=F_y d_x-F_xd_y= -[F]([U])-[E]([V])=-[M]\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$$

Thus, the answer to this question is $[M]~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$, CW or -  $[M]~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}$.
