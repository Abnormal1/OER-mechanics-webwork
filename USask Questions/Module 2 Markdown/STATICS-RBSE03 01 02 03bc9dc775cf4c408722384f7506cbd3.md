Topic/ Unit: 4. Determine unknown forces and moments that will achieve static equilibrium (2D and 3D) for simple rigid bodies (RBSE)

# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

Determine the horizontal and vertical components of reaction at the pin $A$ and the reaction on the beam at $C$.

From the list below, select the option that **is not acceptable** as a list of information that you are required to **find** in this problem:

---

---

a) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, the reaction components at pin $A$

$\overrightarrow{B}$, the reaction from the $4\,\mathrm{kN}$ force at point $B$

---

b) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, the reaction components at pin $A$

$\overrightarrow{C}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{C}_y$, the reaction components at point $C$

---

c) ${A}_x$ & ${A}_y$, ${C}_x$ & ${C}_y$

---

d) ${A}_x$ & ${A}_y$, the reaction components at pin $A$

${C}_x$ & ${C}_y$, the reaction components at point $C$

---

# Answer:

a) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, the reaction components at pin $A$

$\overrightarrow{B}$, the reaction from the $4\,\mathrm{kN}$ force at point $B$

# Feedback:

a) Correct! This option **is not acceptable** because the problem asks for the reaction components at pin $A$ and point $C$, **not** for a reaction at point $B$. 

b) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vectors with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as scalars. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

c) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalars (though they could also be stated as vectors). It is also a good idea to include a word description, though not required. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

d) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalars with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as vectors.
