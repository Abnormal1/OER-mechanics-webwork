# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

The rod is supported by smooth journal bearings at $A$, $B$, and $C$ and is subjected to the two forces shown.  Determine the reactions at these supports.

From the list below, select the option with **the best list of information** that is **given** in the above problem:

---

---

a) A rod supported by smooth journal bearings and subject to two forces

See diagram for dimensions

Coordinate axes as shown

${F}_1=600\hat{k}\,\mathrm{N}$

${F}_2=400\hat{j}\,\mathrm{N}$

See diagram for dimensions

Coordinate axes as shown

$\overrightarrow{F}_1=600\hat{k}\,\mathrm{N}$

$\overrightarrow{F}_2=400\hat{j}\,\mathrm{N}$

---

c) A rod supported by smooth journal bearings and subject to two forces

See diagram for dimensions

# Answer:

b) A rod supported by smooth journal bearings and subject to two forces

See diagram for dimensions

Coordinate axes as shown

$\overrightarrow{F}_1=600\hat{k}\,\mathrm{N}$

$\overrightarrow{F}_2=400\hat{j}\,\mathrm{N}$

# Feedback:

a) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly, as well as referencing the coordinate axes. However, it shows an incorrect notation on the force variables. Since the weight value is reported with the unit vectors $\hat{j}$ and $\hat{k}$, the symbols $F_1$ and $F_2$ need to have an arrow overtop. It would be acceptable to report the force values as scalars, but then no unit vectors would be used i.e. $F_1=600\,\mathrm{N}$. 

b) Correct! This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly. The coordinate axes are referenced, and the two force values are stated properly. This is all the information "given" in this problem.

c) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly, as well as referencing the coordinate axes. However, the values for the given forces are not stated with the correct units. Check the diagram to make sure you are stating the correct units with the force values. 

d) This option has a good, descriptive sentence, and refers to the dimensions in the diagram properly. The values for the forces given are also stated properly. However, there is a set of coordinate axes clearly shown in the diagram, and those should be referenced. Choose an answer that refers to these axes.
