Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

From the options below, select a correct representation of the **vector formulation** of the moment of a force about point $O$.  A position vector $\overrightarrow{r}$ goes from point $O$ to point $A$. A force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$ is applied at point $A$ and is not parallel to $\overrightarrow{r}$. 

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(F_xr_x-F_yr_y)\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(F_yr_x+F_xr_y)\hat{k}$

c) $M_O=(F_yr_x-F_xr_y)$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(F_yr_x-F_xr_y)\hat{k}$

# Answer:

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(F_yr_x-F_xr_y)\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) The option you've chosen has an incorrect pattern of terms for a cross product. The term-by-term representation of the vector formulation of a moment in 2D is the result of the 2D determinant, shown below:

$$\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}r_x&r_y\\F_x&F_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$$

Therefore, the expansion has the form:

$$\overrightarrow{M}_O=(r_xF
_y-r_yF_x)\hat{k}=(F_yr_x-F_xr_y)\hat{k}$$

b) Almost! The term-by-term representation of the vector formulation of a moment in 2D is the result of the 2D determinant, shown below:

$$\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}r_x&r_y\\F_x&F_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$$

Therefore, the expansion has the form:

$$\overrightarrow{M}_O=(r_xF
_y-r_yF_x)\hat{k}=(F_yr_x-F_xr_y)\hat{k}$$

Note the **subtraction** between the two terms above. The option you've chosen shows an addition instead. 

---

c) The option you've chosen is the **scalar formulation** of the moment about point $O$. The **vector formulation** must be written with a unit vector. Remember that the result of the cross product between two 2D vectors in the $xy$ plane is along the $z$ axis, which is why it is written with the unit vector $\hat{k}$.

d) Good job! The term-by-term representation of the vector formulation of a moment in 2D is the result of the 2D determinant, shown below:

$$\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}r_x&r_y\\F_x&F_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$$

Therefore, the expansion has the form:

$$\overrightarrow{M}_O=(r_xF
_y-r_yF_x)\hat{k}=(F_yr_x-F_xr_y)\hat{k}$$

Remember that the result of the cross product between two 2D vectors in the $xy$ plane is along the $z$ axis, which is why it is written with the unit vector $\hat{k}$.
