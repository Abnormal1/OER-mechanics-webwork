# Answer:

Yes

# Feedback:

If two couples produce a moment with the same magnitude and direction, then these two couples are equivalent. In this question, both couples cause a tendency of CW rotation, and each couple moment has a magnitude of $|\overrightarrow{M}|=30~\text{N}~(4 ~\text{m})=60~\text{N}~(2 ~\text{m})= 120~\text{N}\cdot\text{m}$. Thus, the two couples presented in this question are equivalent.
