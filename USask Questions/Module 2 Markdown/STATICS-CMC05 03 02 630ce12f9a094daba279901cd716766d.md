# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

If two couples produce a moment with the same magnitude and direction, then these two couples are equivalent. In this question, each couple moment has a magnitude of $|\overrightarrow{M}|=40~\text{lb}~(2 ~\text{ft})=20~\text{lb}~(4 ~\text{ft})= 80~\text{lb}\cdot\text{ft}$. However, the one on the left hand side causes a tendency of CW rotation, while the one on the right hand side causes a tendency of CCW rotation. Thus, the two couples presented in this question are **NOT** equivalent.
