Assume you have solved this problem.  The FBD below shows your calculated values. 

![STATICS-RBSE07%2002%2001%20ae08e0aea6e84b4ba194e5e9c85d91dd/Untitled.png](STATICS-RBSE07%2002%2001%20ae08e0aea6e84b4ba194e5e9c85d91dd/Untitled.png)

From the list of potential conclusions shown below, select the best conclusion.

# Answer:

a. The horizontal and vertical components of reaction of the pin A are 33.4 $\text{lb}$ and 61.3 $\text{lb}$, respectively.

b. The tension in the cable is 74.6 $\text{lb}$, and reaction forces are 33.4 $\text{lb}$ and 61.3 $\text{lb}$.

c. $\text{A}_\text{x}=33.4 ~\text{lb}$, $\text{A}_\text{y}=-61.3~\text{lb}$, and $\text{T}=74.6 ~\text{lb}$.

d. The tension in the cable is 74.6 $\text{lb}$, and the horizontal and vertical components of reaction of the pin A are 33.4 $\text{lb}$ and -61.3 $\text{lb}$, respectively.

# Feedback:

a. The question also asked about the tension in the cable, which is missing from this conclusion. 

b. The second half of this question can be more precise. It is unclear which numerical result is the horizontal component and which one is the vertical component. 

c. The information in this conclusion is comprehensive and correct.  However, a conclusion to a problem should provide an informative **sentence** that answers the original question.

d. Well done! The conclusion to a problem must provide an informative sentence that answers the original question.  This answer does that, with all necessary specifics.
