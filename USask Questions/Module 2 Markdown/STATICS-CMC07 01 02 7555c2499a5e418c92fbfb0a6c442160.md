# Question:

Which of the following options can be described as a **free vector?**

a) Resultant moment vector

b) Force vector

c) Couple moment vector

# Answer:

c) Couple moment vector

# Feedback:

a) A resultant moment vector is **not** a free vector because it must be calculated about a specific point on the body. The moment arms of the forces that generate the resultant moment vector are important in the calculation and cannot be changed arbitrarily. We can describe something as a **free vector** if the point of application (or calculation) of the vector does not matter where it occurs i.e. it can be applied at any point on a body or can be calculated at any point on a body. 

b) A force vector is **not** a free vector since the location of the vector matters very much. We can describe something as a **free vector** if the point of application (or calculation) of the vector does not matter where it occurs i.e. it can be applied at any point on a body or can be calculated at any point on a body. 

c) Correct! A couple moment is a **free vector** i.e. it has magnitude and direction and can act at *any point* on a body.
