Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

From the options below, select a correct representation of the **vector formulation** of the moment of the force about point $O$, given the following diagram:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}\\r_x&r_y\\F_x&F_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}F_x&F_y\\r_x&r_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}r_x&r_y\\F_x&F_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

d) $M_O=\begin{vmatrix}r_x&r_y\\F_x&F_y\\\end{vmatrix}$

# Answer:

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}r_x&r_y\\F_x&F_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) Almost! This is the right idea, but when creating the matrix used to calculate the determinant of a 2D cross product, the unit vectors are not included in the first row. To create the matrix for the moment due to a force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$ on a moment arm with position vector $\overrightarrow{r}$, the components of the position vector are placed in the first row, and the components of the force vector are placed in the second row. 

b) While this option has all the correct components, the rows are in the wrong order.  Remember that to create the matrix for the moment due to a force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$ on a moment arm with position vector $\overrightarrow{r}$, the components of the **position vector** are placed in the first row, and the components of the **force vector** are placed in the second row. 

c) Correct! One way to express the vector formulation of the moment about point $O$ is in its determinant form. For two 2D vectors, one position vector $\overrightarrow{r}$ and one force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$, the cross product can be calculated in the form of a 2D determinant. The components of the position vector are placed in the first row, and the components of the force vector are placed in the second row. Remember that the result of a cross product between two 2D vectors in the $xy$ plane will be along the $z$ axis, and must be stated with the unit vector $\hat{k}$.  

d) While this option has the correct pattern, it is stated as a **scalar**. Remember that the **vector result** of a cross product between two 2D vectors in the $xy$ plane will be along the $z$ axis, and must be stated with the unit vector $\hat{k}$.
