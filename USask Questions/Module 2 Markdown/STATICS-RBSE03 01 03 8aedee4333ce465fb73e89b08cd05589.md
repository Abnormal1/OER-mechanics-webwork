# Question:

Consider the following problem statement:

---

The truss is supported by a pin at $A$ and a roller at $B$. Determine the support reactions.

From the list below, select the option that **is not acceptable** as a list of information that you are required to **find** in this problem:

---

---

a) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$, $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, & $\overrightarrow{B}_y$

---

b) $\overrightarrow{A}$, the support reaction at pin $A$

$\overrightarrow{B}$, the support reaction at roller $B$

---

c) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, the reaction components at pin $A$

---

d) ${A}_x$ & ${A}_y$, the reaction components at pin $A$

${B}_y$, the reaction component at roller $B$

---

# Answer:

c) $\overrightarrow{A}_x$ & $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, the reaction components at pin $A$

# Feedback:

a) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vector components (although they could also be stated as scalar components). Note that there is no $\overrightarrow{B}_x$ component because a roller does not have a horizontal support reaction. It is also a good idea to include a word description, though not required. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

---

b) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as vectors with an additional word description to match.  Note that it is not necessary to state each vector component separately (i.e. $\overrightarrow{A}_x$, $\overrightarrow{A}_y$, etc.), although that would be a good idea just so you can remind yourself of which components you need to solve for.  Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem. 

---

c) Correct! This option **is not acceptable** because the problem asks for the "the support reactions". This implies finding support reactions at **all support points**, or in this case, at **both** points $A$ and $B$. 

d) This answer is **acceptable** because it has the variables clearly stated as scalars with an additional word description to match. The word description is not necessary, although it is a good idea to include. It would also be acceptable to state the variables as vectors. Note that there is no ${B}_x$ component because a roller does not have a horizontal support reaction. Choose the option that would **not be acceptable** as a statement of the information you need to find in this problem.
