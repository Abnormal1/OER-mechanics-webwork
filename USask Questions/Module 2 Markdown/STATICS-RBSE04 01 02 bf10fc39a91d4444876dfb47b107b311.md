# Feedback:

a. A pin support is usually free to rotate i.e. it is frictionless. Thus there should be only two unknowns associated with the pin support at $A$ i.e. $A_x$ and $A_y$.

b. Well done! This is the correct FBD for member AB, and you should be able to solve for the reaction forces based on this FBD.

c. Member CD is pin-pin connected.  It is a 2-force member (2FM) and thus works the same way as a link support. There is only one unknown associated with a link support (or 2FM), which is the magnitude of the reaction force acting along the axis of the link. Therefore, there should not be a moment in the FBD at point C. 

d. Member CD is pin-pin connected.  It is a 2-force member (2FM) and thus works the same way as a link support. There is only one unknown associated with a link support (or 2FM), which is the magnitude of the reaction force acting along the axis of the link. Therefore, the direction of the reaction force on the beam at C is incorrect.
