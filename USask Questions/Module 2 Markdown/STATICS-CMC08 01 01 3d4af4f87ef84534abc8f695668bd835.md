# Question

Determine the x and y components of the resultant force and the resultant couple moment for the equivalent force couple at point O. Express the sense of the moment with a + or - sign in front of your answer, where + is for CCW and - is for CW.

Resultant force at point O: $\{$____$\hat{i}+$____$\hat{j}\} \text{~N}$

Resultant couple moment at point O: ________ $\text{N}\cdot\text{m}$

# Answer:

$100,~0$

$0$

# Feedback:

Force is a sliding vector, since it will create the same external effects on a body when it is applied at any point $P$ along its line of action. This is called the principle of transmissibility. 

In this question, Point $O$ is located on the line of action of the 100 $\text{N}$ force. Thus, we can simply move the force from $A$ to $O$, and no additional moment is produced about $O$.
