# Answer:

a. An airplane can be considered a particle when analyzing the reaction forces at the wheels. 

b. An airplane can be considered a rigid body when analyzing the reaction forces at the wheels. 

c. both a and b

d. neither a nor b

# Feedback:

a.  An airplane **CANNOT** be considered as a particle when analyzing the reaction forces at the wheels, because the reaction forces and the weight are parallel to each other and do not meet at a single point.  

b. Good job! The deformation of the air plane is likely to be small, thus it can be considered to be a rigid body when analyzing the reaction forces. 

c. An airplane **CANNOT** be considered as a particle when analyzing the reaction forces at the wheels, because the reaction forces and the weight are parallel to each other and do not meet at a single point.  However, the deformation of the air plane is likely to be small, thus it can be considered to be a rigid body when analyzing the reaction forces.
