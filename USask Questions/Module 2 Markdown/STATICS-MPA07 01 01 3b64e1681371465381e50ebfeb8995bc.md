Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

Determining the moment about point O in a 3D problem requires taking the cross product between a position vector depicting the moment arm, and the force vector. If each vector is expressed in Cartesian coordinates as such:

$$\overrightarrow{r}=r_x\hat{i}+r_y\hat{j}+r_z\hat{k}\\\overrightarrow{F}=F_x\hat{i}+F_y\hat{j}+F_z\hat{k}$$

then select the correct representation of the determinant form of the vector moment calculation:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\F_x&F_y&F_z\\r_x&r_y&r_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\r_x&r_y&r_z\\F_x&F_y&F_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{x}&\hat{y}&\hat{z}\\r_x&r_y&r_z\\F_x&F_y&F_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}r_x&r_y \\F_x&F_y \\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

# Answer:

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\r_x&r_y&r_z\\F_x&F_y&F_z\\\end{vmatrix}$

# Feedback:

a) Close! The determinant representing the vector formulation of the moment about point O comes from the cross product $\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$. The determinant in this option depicts the cross product in the wrong order, $\overrightarrow{F}\times\overrightarrow{r}$. In other words, the $\overrightarrow{r}$ and $\overrightarrow{F}$ vectors are in the wrong rows in this option.

b) Correct! The determinant representing the vector formulation of the moment about point O comes from the cross product $\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$. We know that the determinant for the moment vector has three rows: the first made from the unit vectors, the second row is the position vector, and the third row is the force vector, with $xyz$ components placed from left to right.

c) The determinant representing the vector formulation of the moment about point O comes from the cross product $\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$. We know that the determinant for the moment vector has three rows: the first made from the unit vectors, the second row is the position vector, and the third row is the force vector, with xyz components placed from left to right. While this option has the correct general set-up, the unit vectors in the first row are not denoted by the correct variables.

d) This would be the correct determinant if $\overrightarrow{r}$ and $\overrightarrow{F}$ were 2D vectors. For 3D vectors, the determinant has three rows: the first made from the unit vectors, the second row is the position vector, and the third row is the force vector, with $xyz$ components placed from left to right.
