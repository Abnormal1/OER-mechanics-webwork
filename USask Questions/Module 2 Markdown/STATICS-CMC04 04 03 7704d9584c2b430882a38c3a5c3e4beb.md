# Question:

The diagram below shows two force vectors of equal magnitude applied parallel and opposite to each other:  $\overrightarrow{F}=(16\hat{i}+12\hat{j})\,\mathrm{N}$ and $-\overrightarrow{F}=(-16\hat{i}-12\hat{j})\,\mathrm{N}$. A position vector goes from one force vector to the other, $\overrightarrow{r}=(6\hat{i}-10\hat{j})\,\mathrm{m}$. Calculate the couple moment due to these two vectors using the **vector formulation**. Report your answer as a whole number, with the appropriate positive or negative sign in front depicting the direction of the moment.

$$\overrightarrow{M}=(\_\_\_\,\hat{k})\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}$$

# Answer:

$$\overrightarrow{M}=(232\,\hat{k})\,\mathrm{N\cdot m}$$

# Feedback:

The **vector formulation** of a couple moment has the form:

$$\overrightarrow{M}=\overrightarrow{r}\times\overrightarrow{F}$$

where $\overrightarrow{M}$ is the moment, $\overrightarrow{r}$ is the position vector from one coupled force to another, and $\overrightarrow{F}$ is the force vector to which the position vector is pointing. Remember that a cross product between two 2D vectors involves calculating the determinant:

$$\overrightarrow{M}=\begin{vmatrix}r_x&r_y\\F_x&F_y\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}=(r_xF_y-r_yF_x)\hat{k}$$

The correct positive or negative sign will come from the cross product if the components are entered correctly. The cross product between two vectors in the $xy$ plane is always along the $z$ axis, and therefore accompanied by the $\hat{k}$ unit vector.
