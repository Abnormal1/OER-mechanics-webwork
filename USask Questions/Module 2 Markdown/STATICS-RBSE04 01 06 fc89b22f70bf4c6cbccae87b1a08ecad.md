# Feedback:

a. The weight of the bar is missing in this FBD. If the mass or weight of the member is not mentioned in the question, then the member can usually be assumed to be weightless. However, since it is mentioned that the mass of the bar is 25 $\text{kg}$, we have to calculate the weight from the given mass and show it on the FBD.

b. Observe the structure of the peg support. It is free to rotate and to slide in the tangential direction. Thus, the only unknown is the reaction force acting **perpendicular** to the member. 

c. Observe the structure of the peg support. It is free to rotate and to slide in the tangential direction. Thus, the only unknown is the reaction force acting **perpendicular** to the member.  The way this force is drawn, it would have perpendicular and tangential components with respect to the slot. 

d. Good job! This is the correct FBD for the member, and you should be able to solve for the reaction forces based on this FBD.
