Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 3D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{j}+A_z{k}\\\overrightarrow{B}=B_x\hat{i}+B_y\hat{j}+B_z\hat{k}\\$$

In order to find the cross product between these two vectors, you must calculate the determinant, which can be set up as:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\A_x&A_y&A_z\\B_x&B_y&B_z\\\end{vmatrix}$$

From the options below, select the correct form of the determinant as calculated from the above expression:

a) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\A_x&A_y&A_z\\B_x&B_y&B_z\\\end{vmatrix}=(A_yB_z-A_zB_y)\hat{i}-(A_xB_z-A_zB_x)\hat{j}+(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{k}$

b) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\A_x&A_y&A_z\\B_x&B_y&B_z\\\end{vmatrix}=(A_yB_z-A_zB_y)\hat{i}+(A_xB_z-A_zB_x)\hat{j}+(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{k}$

c) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\A_x&A_y&A_z\\B_x&B_y&B_z\\\end{vmatrix}=(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{i}-(A_yB_z-A_zB_y)\hat{j}+(A_zB_x-A_xB_z)\hat{k}$

d) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\A_x&A_y&A_z\\B_x&B_y&B_z\\\end{vmatrix}=(A_xB_x)\hat{i}-(A_yB_y)\hat{j}+(A_zB_z)\hat{k}$

# Answer:

a) $\begin{vmatrix}\hat{i}&\hat{j}&\hat{k}\\A_x&A_y&A_z\\B_x&B_y&B_z\\\end{vmatrix}=(A_yB_z-A_zB_y)\hat{i}-(A_xB_z-A_zB_x)\hat{j}+(A_xB_y-A_yB_x)\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) Great job! When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow. Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants.

b) When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow. Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants. 

In this option, the order of the terms is correct, but the signs are not.

c) When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow. Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants. 

In this option, the patterns between the components are correct but they're not paired up with the proper unit vectors.

d) When you find the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix, follow the pattern outlined below:

![STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png](STATICS-VCP07%2002%2004%2082d9fd00bbf54807a85cbeeef3e50263/Untitled.png)

For each component circled in green, find the product of the components covered by the red arrow and then subtract the product of the components covered by the blue arrow.Notice the difference in signs between the first, second, and third determinants. 

In this option, the result resembles the **dot product** more than the cross product.
