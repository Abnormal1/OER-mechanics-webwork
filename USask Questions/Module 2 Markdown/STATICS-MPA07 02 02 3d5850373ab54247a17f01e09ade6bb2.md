Topic/ Unit: 2. Calculate the moment of a force about a point or an axis in 2D and 3D using vector and scalar formulations (MPA)

# Question:

Determining the moment about point O in a 3D problem requires taking the cross product between a position vector depicting the moment arm, and the force vector. If each vector is depicted in Cartesian coordinates as such:

$$\overrightarrow{r}=\alpha\hat{i}+\beta\hat{j}+\gamma\hat{k}\\\overrightarrow{F}=U\hat{i}+V\hat{j}+W\hat{k}$$

then select the correct representation of the determinant expansion of the vector moment calculation:

a) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(\beta W+\gamma V)\hat{i}+(\alpha W+\gamma U)\hat{j}+(\alpha V+\beta U)\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(\beta W-\gamma V)\hat{i}-(\alpha W-\gamma U)\hat{j}+(\alpha V-\beta U)\hat{k}$

c) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(\beta W-\gamma V)-(\alpha W-\gamma U)+(\alpha V-\beta U)$

d) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(\alpha V-\beta U)\hat{i}-(\beta W-\gamma V)\hat{j}+(\alpha W-\gamma U)\hat{k}$

# Answer:

b) $\overrightarrow{M}_O=(\beta W-\gamma V)\hat{i}-(\alpha W-\gamma U)\hat{j}+(\alpha V-\beta U)\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) Remember that the determinant of a 2D matrix involves **subtracting** the second product from the first. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

As well, notice the negative sign in front of the $\hat{j}$ term. This negative sign is also missing in the option you’ve selected.

b) Good job! Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

This option shows the correct order of terms! Even though the vectors in this problem are presented with different variables, the pattern remains the same. Remember the negative sign in front of the $\hat{j}$ term in the middle.

c) While the order and pattern of terms in this option is correct, it’s missing the appropriate unit vectors. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

Each term must be multiplied by the proper unit vector.

d) While the pattern of terms within the brackets is correct, their order is not. Consider the pattern for calculating a 3D determinant in the diagram below:

![STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png](STATICS-MPA07%2002%2004%20edce8de67f5b4d00b9c1e9733f5a7b34/Untitled.png)

The y & z components are paired with the $\hat{i}$ term, the x & z components with the $\hat{j}$ term, and the x & y components with the $\hat{k}$ term. Even though the vectors in this problem are presented with different variables, the pattern remains the same.
