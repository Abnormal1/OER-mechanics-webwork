Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=5\hat{i}-2\hat{j}\\\overrightarrow{B}=\hat{i}+8\hat{j}\\$$

From the options below, select the correct representation of the 2 x 2 matrix needed to calculate the determinant:

a) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}5&-2\\1&8\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}5&2\\1&8\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}5&-2\\0&8\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}5&1\\-2&8\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

# Answer:

a) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}5&-2\\1&8\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) Correct! When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right. Notice the negative sign is retained in the $A_y$ term, and the "missing" number in the $B_x$ component is actually a 1.

b) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right. Watch that you include all negative signs with the appropriate terms. 

c) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right. Note that if a component doesn't seem to have a number, as in $B_x$, then it is actually a 1. 

d) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right. This option has all the correct numbers, but they are arranged as columns instead of rows.
