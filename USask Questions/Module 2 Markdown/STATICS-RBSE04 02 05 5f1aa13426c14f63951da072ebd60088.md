# Feedback:

a. Note the member is supported by a **square** shaft at $\text{A}$. Thus, in addition to the reaction forces and moments shown, it can also resist rotation about the z-axis. 

b. Good job! This is the correct FBD for the member, and you should be able to solve for the reactions at $\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$ based on this FBD.

c. There are **five** unknowns associated with a single journal bearing support with **square** shaft. The reactions are two force and three couple-moment components. Although the couple moments are generally not applied if the force reactions are sufficient for equilibrium, it is not true for this case. For example, the 500 $\text{N}$ applied force creates moments about the z- and x-axes. There is no other force that can cancel out these moments. Therefore, these moments must be resisted by the couple moment reactions of the bearing.  

d. The moment reactions are correct. But the force reactions should be in the x and y-directions at $\text{A}$. The journal bearing does not have any resistance to motion in the z-direction because the problem statement said "smooth" square hole.
