# Feedback:

a. The reaction forces at the hinges are correct. But the weight of the door is missing. 

b. As stated in the question, hinge B resists only forces in the x- and y-direction. So $\bold{B_z}$ should not be there. 

c. Good job! This is the correct FBD for the door, and you should be able to solve for the reactions at $\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$ based on this FBD.

d. The three force and two couple moment reactions shown in this FBD is correct for a typical hinge support. However, it is stated in this question that "hinge $\text{B}$ resists only forces in the **x** **and** **y** directions and $\text{A}$ resists forces in the **x, y, and z** directions".
