Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane such that:

$$\overrightarrow{A}=\alpha\hat{i}+\beta\hat{j}\\\overrightarrow{B}=\gamma\hat{i}+\delta\hat{j}\\$$

From the options below, select the correct representation of the 2 x 2 matrix needed to calculate the determinant:

a) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\alpha&\gamma\\\beta&\delta\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

b) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\beta&\alpha\\\delta&\gamma\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

c) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\gamma&\delta\\\alpha&\beta\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\alpha&\beta\\\gamma&\delta\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

# Answer:

d) $\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=\begin{vmatrix}\alpha&\beta\\\gamma&\delta\\\end{vmatrix}\hat{k}$

# Feedback:

a) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right.  In this option, the vectors are mistakenly placed as columns, with their components going from top to bottom. 

b) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right.  In this option, the terms are placed right to left instead. 

c) When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right.  In this option, vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ was placed on the bottom and vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ was placed on top. 

d) Great job! When setting up the 2 x 2 matrix to find a determinant, the components from the first vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ go in the top row and the components from the second vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ go in the bottom row, placing the terms left to right.
