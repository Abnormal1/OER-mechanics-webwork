Topic/ Unit: 1. Calculate cross products of 2D and 3D vectors (VCP)

# Question:

Consider two 2D vectors, $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$, that only exist in the $x$-$y$ plane. Vector $\overrightarrow{A}$ has magnitude $A$ and vector $\overrightarrow{B}$ has magnitude $B$. The angle between the two vectors is denoted by $\theta$. 

The **dot product** of these two vectors can be expressed as:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}=AB\cos\theta$$

The **cross product** of these two vectors can be expressed as:

$$\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}=(AB\sin\theta)\hat{k}$$

What is the effective expression of the dot product and the cross product if angle $\theta=90\degree$?

a) $|\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}|=0,\,\,|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=0$

b) $|\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}|=0,\,\,|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB$

c) $|\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}|=AB,\,\,|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=0$

d) $|\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}|=AB,\,\,|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB$

# Answer:

b) $|\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}|=0,\,\,|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB$

# Feedback:

a) When $\theta=90\degree$, $\cos\theta=0$ and $\sin\theta=1$. This means the dot product becomes:

$$|\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\cos\theta=AB(0)=0$$

Conversely, the magnitude of the cross product becomes:

$$|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\sin\theta=AB(1)=AB$$

Recall that the dot product will be **minimzed** when the vectors are perpendicular ($\theta=90\degree$), since there is no projection from one to the other.  The cross product will be **maximized** in this case. 

This option has both products going to zero, but this would not happen.

b) Correct! When $\theta=90\degree$, $\cos\theta=0$ and $\sin\theta=1$. This means the dot product becomes:

$$|\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\cos\theta=AB(0)=0$$

Conversely, the magnitude of the cross product becomes:

$$|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\sin\theta=AB(1)=AB$$

Recall that the dot product will be **minimzed** when the vectors are perpendicular ($\theta=90\degree$), since there is no projection from one to the other.  The cross product will be **maximized** in this case.

c) When $\theta=90\degree$, $\cos\theta=0$ and $\sin\theta=1$. This means the dot product becomes:

$$|\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\cos\theta=AB(0)=0$$

Conversely, the magnitude of the cross product becomes:

$$|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\sin\theta=AB(1)=AB$$

Recall that the dot product will be **minimzed** when the vectors are perpendicular ($\theta=90\degree$), since there is no projection from one to the other.  The cross product will be **maximized** in this case. 

This option has the effect on the products reversed.

d) When $\theta=90\degree$, $\cos\theta=0$ and $\sin\theta=1$. This means the dot product becomes:

$$|\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\cos\theta=AB(0)=0$$

Conversely, the magnitude of the cross product becomes:

$$|\overrightarrow{A}\times\overrightarrow{B}|=AB\sin\theta=AB(1)=AB$$

Recall that the dot product will be **minimzed** when the vectors are perpendicular ($\theta=90\degree$), since there is no projection from one to the other.  The cross product will be **maximized** in this case. 

This option has both products maximized to $AB$, but this would not happen.
