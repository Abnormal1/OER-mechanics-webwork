Which of the following notations can be used to represent the magnitude of the moment reaction of the fixed support at $\text{A}$? (Select all that apply)

# Answer:

a. $\bold{M_{A}}$

b. $\text{M}_\text{A}$

c. $\text{m}_\text{A}$

d. $|\overrightarrow{M}_\text{A}|$

# Feedback:

### Answer specific feedback:

a. This is a vector notation. The magnitude of a moment is a scalar. See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

b. Good job! This is one of the correct answers. See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

c. Remember that we use $\text{M}$ for moment, and $\text{m}$ for mass.

d. Good job! This is one of the correct answers. See below for more information about vector and scalar notations. 

### General feedback:

It is common to confuse vector notation with scalar notation. Note the following accepted notations for both:

$$\mathrm{vector}:\overrightarrow{A}\;\mathrm{or}\;\bold{A}$$

$$\mathrm{scalar}:|\overrightarrow{A}|\;\mathrm{or}\;\text{A}$$

Scalar values are typically represented with a simple variable symbol, e.g. $\text{A}$, but can be represented as the magnitude of a vector, e.g. $|\overrightarrow{A}|$.
