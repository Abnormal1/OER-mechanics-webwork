e. This member is not a ZFM. See below for the solution of this question.

f. There are two ZFMs in this case. See below for the solution of this question.

### General

The ZFMs of a truss can be identified by analyzing the FBD at each joint. See the FBD at joint $A$ below. $\bold{F_{AC}}$ and $\bold{F_{AB}}$ are the only force in the x- or y- direction, respectively. They must be ZFMs, otherwise the joint can not be in equilibrium. This scenario can be generalized as: *if a joint is connected to only **two non-collinear** members, and there is no other force acting on it, then these two members must be ZFMs.*
