Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a horizontal force is pushing on an object. Given $P=5~\text{N}$, and $F_s=8~\text{kN}$, which one of the following statement is **incorrect?**

# Answer:

a. The object has no impending motion.

b. The object is in equilibrium.

c. The object is not in equilibrium.

d. The frictional force is equal to $5 ~\text{N}$.

# Feedback:

a. This statement is correct. However, this question is asking you to identify the incorrect one. When the applied force is less than the maximum static frictional force $F_s$, the object has no impending motion.

b. This statement is correct. However, this question is asking you to identify the incorrect one. When the applied force is less than the maximum static frictional force $F_s$, the object has no impending motion. The object is in static equilibrium, and the frictional force is equal and opposite to the applied force to maintain the force equilibrium in the horizontal direction. 

c. Good job! This statement is incorrect. When the applied force is less than the maximum static frictional force $F_s$, the object has no impending motion and remains in static equilibrium. The frictional force is equal and opposite to the applied force to maintain the force equilibrium in the horizontal direction. 

d. This statement is correct. However, this question is asking you to identify the incorrect one. When the applied force is less than the maximum static frictional force $F_s$, the object has no impending motion. The object is in static equilibrium, and the frictional force is equal and opposite to the applied force to maintain the force equilibrium in the horizontal direction.
