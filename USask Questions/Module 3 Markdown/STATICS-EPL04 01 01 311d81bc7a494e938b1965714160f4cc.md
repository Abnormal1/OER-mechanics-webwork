# Question:

Consider the uniform beam in the diagram below with the given centre of gravity (COG) and force due to gravity shown:

If the beam has a linear mass density of $5\,\mathrm{kg/m}$, what is the correct **magnitude** of the force due to gravity (weight)? Submit your answer to three significant figures:

$$|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=\,\_\_\_\_\_\,\mathrm{N}$$

# Answer:

$$|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=\underline\bold{22.1}\,\mathrm{N}$$

# Feedback:

When a **linear mass density** is given (in $\mathrm{kg/m}$), it must be multiplied by the length of the beam to find the actual mass of the object (and the dimensions must match!):

$$m_\mathrm{beam}= 5\,\mathrm{kg/m}(0.45\,\mathrm{m})$$

Then, the mass of the beam, $m_\mathrm{beam}$, can be multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity,  $g=9.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$, to get the magnitude of the weight, or the force due to gravity:

$$|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=m_\mathrm{beam}{g}$$

Remember that the standard unit of force & weight, $\mathrm{N}$, is a derived unit from the arrangement  $\mathrm{kg\cdot m/s^2}$.  Don't forget to round your answer to three significant digits!
