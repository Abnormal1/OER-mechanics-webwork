# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a beam is subjected to a triangular distributed load. Given $w_1=[A]~\text{kN/m}$, determine the magnitude of the equivalent resultant force.

**Enter your answer:** 

The magnitude of the equivalent resultant force =  _____ $\text{kN}$

### **Variable Parameters**

$[A]:$ Range (3, 10), in steps of 1

$[C]:[C]=\frac{6\times[A]}{2}$ 

# Answer:

$[C]$

# Feedback:

For a triangular distributed load, the magnitude of its equivalent resultant force is one half of the peak value of the distributed load times the distance over which it acts. Thus, for this question:

$$\frac{[A]~\text{kN/m}\times(6~\text{m})}{2}=[C]~\text{kN}$$

Note that the magnitude of the equivalent resultant force is equal to the area of the shape that describes the distributed loading. The formula above can be understood as the area formula for a triangle.
