# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a bulkhead is subjected to water pressure. Knowing the water pressure increases linearly with the depth measured from the water's surface, determine the magnitude of the equivalent resultant force. 

**Enter your answer:** 

The magnitude of the equivalent resultant force =  _____ $\text{kN}$

# Answer:

90

# Feedback:

For a triangular distributed load, the magnitude of its equivalent resultant force is one half of the peak value of the distributed load times the distance over which it acts. Thus, for this question:

$$\frac{100~\text{kN/m}\times(1.8~\text{m})}{2}=90~\text{kN}$$

Note that the magnitude of the equivalent resultant force is equal to the area of the shape that describes the distributed loading. The formula above can be understood as the area formula for a triangle.
