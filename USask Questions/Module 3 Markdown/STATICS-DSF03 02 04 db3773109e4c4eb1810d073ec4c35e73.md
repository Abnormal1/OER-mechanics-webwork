Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below, an external force $P$ is applied to the box. Given the weight of the box is $W$, and the box is on the verge of moving, determine the value of the static coefficient of friction.

# Answer:

a. $\mu_s=\frac{P}{W}$

b. $\mu_k=\frac{P}{W}$

c. $\mu_s=\frac{W}{P}$

d. $\mu_k=\frac{W}{P}$

# Feedback:

### Answer specific feedback:

a. Well done! Since the object is on the verge of moving, $P$ is equal to the maximum static frictional force, i.e. $P=F_s=\mu_sW$. Therefore, $\mu_s=\frac{P}{W}$. 

b. The expression $\frac{P}{W}$ is correct, however, $\mu_k$ represents the **kinetic** coefficient of friction. The correct notation for the static coefficient of friction is $\mu_s$.

c. Since the object is on the verge of moving, $P$ is equal to the maximum static frictional force, i.e. $P=F_s=\mu_sW$. Therefore, $\mu_s=\frac{P}{W}$. 

d. Since the object is on the verge of moving, $P$ is equal to the maximum static frictional force, i.e. $P=F_s=\mu_sW$. Therefore, $\mu_s=\frac{P}{W}$. Also,  $\mu_k$ represents the **kinetic** coefficient of friction. The correct notation for the static coefficient of friction is $\mu_s$.
