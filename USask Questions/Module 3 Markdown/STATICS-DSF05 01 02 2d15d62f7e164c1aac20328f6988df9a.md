Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

Assuming the normal force and the surface roughness remain constant for an object sliding over a surface, which one of the following statements is correct about the frictional force?

# Answer:

a. The frictional force does not change with the speed of the object as long as the object is moving. 

b. The frictional force increases as the speed of the object increases.  

c. The frictional force decreases as the speed of the object increases.

d. The frictional force is assumed to be roughly constant in most cases. However, it is actually higher (closer to the static frictional force) when the speed is very slow, and it is lower when the speed is extremely high. 

# Feedback:

a. The frictional force on a moving object remains roughly the same for a wide range of speeds. However, the frictional force is actually closer to the static frictional force when the speed is closer to zero, and it is lower when the speed is extremely high. See below for a figure showing the relationship between kinetic frictional force and speed. 

b. The frictional force on a moving object remains roughly the same for a wide range of speeds. However, the frictional force is actually closer to the static frictional force when the speed is closer to zero, and it is lower when the speed is extremely high. See below for a figure showing the relationship between kinetic frictional force and speed. 

c. The frictional force on a moving object remains roughly the same for a wide range of speeds. However, the frictional force is actually closer to the static frictional force when the speed is closer to zero, and it is lower when the speed is extremely high. See below for a figure showing the relationship between kinetic frictional force and speed. 

d. Well done! See below for a figure showing the relationship between kinetic frictional force and speed.
