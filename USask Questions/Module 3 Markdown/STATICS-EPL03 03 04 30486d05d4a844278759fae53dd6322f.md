# Question:

Consider the symmetrical outline of a car below, where our assumption of symmetry covers both the shape and the density of the two sides:

![STATICS-EPL03%2003%2004%2030486d05d4a844278759fae53dd6322f/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL03%2003%2004%2030486d05d4a844278759fae53dd6322f/Untitled.png)

In the blank below, enter the $y$ coordinate of the position of the **centre of gravity (COG)** of the object. Submit your answer as a whole number chosen from the $y$ axis:

${y}=\,\_\_\_\_$

# Answer:

${y}=\underline\bold{3}$

# Feedback:

Although we don't know the exact location horizontally of the COG, we do know it is on the **symmetrical midline** of a complex symmetrical body such as the one above. The midline of the symmetrical car shown in this problem is a horizontal line starting at the centre of the back bumper at the left and finishing through the centre of the front bumper at the right.
