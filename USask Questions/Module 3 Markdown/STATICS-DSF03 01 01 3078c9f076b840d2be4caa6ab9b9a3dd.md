Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

Which one of the following statements is correct about dry friction involving impending motion at **all** points of contact?

# Answer:

a. The number of unknowns will be **less than** the number of available equations (equilibrium equations plus friction equations or tipping equations)

b. The number of unknowns will be **equal to** the number of available equations (equilibrium equations plus friction equations or tipping equations)

c. The number of unknowns will be **more than** the number of available equations (equilibrium equations plus friction equations or tipping equations)

# Feedback:

a. In this case, the object is still in equilibrium.  The number of unknowns will be **equal to** the number of available equations.  Also, $F_s=\mu_sN$.

b. Well done! In this case, the object is still in equilibrium.  The number of unknowns will be **equal to** the number of available equations.  Also, $F_s=\mu_sN$.

c. In this case, the object is still in equilibrium.  The number of unknowns will be **equal to** the number of available equations.  Also, $F_s=\mu_sN$.
