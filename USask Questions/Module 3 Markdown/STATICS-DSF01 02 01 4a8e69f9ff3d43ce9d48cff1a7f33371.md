Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

What causes friction?

# Answer:

a. force equilibrium 

b. law of universal gravitation

c. microscopic irregularities on the contacting surfaces

# Feedback:

### Specific feedbackï¼š

a. This answer is incorrect. See below for the solution of this question.

b. This answer is incorrect. See below for the solution of this question.

c. Good job! See below for the solution of this question.

### General feedback:

In the real world, even the smoothest surface has some irregularities on it.  As shown in the figure below, diagonal reaction forces are developed at each point of contact. The sum of the vertical components of these reaction forces should equal the weight of the object. And the sum of the horizontal components of these reaction forces is the total friction force acting on the object.
