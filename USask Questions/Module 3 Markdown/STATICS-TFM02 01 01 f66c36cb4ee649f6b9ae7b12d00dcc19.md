Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

Which one of the following is the most appropriate procedure for the method of joints?

# Answer:

a. Find the easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Find the next easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Continue until all members are solved $\rightarrow$ Last joint should be a check of your work

b. Solve for ground reaction forces $\rightarrow$ Find the easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Find the next easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Continue until all members are solved 

c. Solve for ground reaction forces $\rightarrow$ Find the easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Find the next easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Continue until all members are solved $\rightarrow$ Last joint should be a check of your work

# Feedback:

a. You might want to start with solving for the ground reaction forces. Then the joints at the supports are often (but not always) the easiest joints to solve. 

b. You should be able to solve all members before the last joint is used. So don't stop there. Go ahead and use the last joint as a check of your work.

c. Well done! This is the most appropriate procedure for the method of joints.
