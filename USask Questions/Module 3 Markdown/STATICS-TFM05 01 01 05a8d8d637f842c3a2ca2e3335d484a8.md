Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question：

Which one of the following is the correct definition of a frame?

# Answer：

a. A frame is a structure made of slender two-force members joined at end points.

b. A frame is made of rigidly connected multi-force members.

c. A frame is made of pin-connected multi-force members.

d. A frame is made of pin-connected or rigidly connected multi-force members.

# Feedback：

a. This is the definition for a truss not for a frame. A frame is not limited to be made of 2FMs.  

b. Frames are often pin-connected.

c. Frames are often pin-connected, but can be rigidly connected as well. 

d. Good job! This is the correct definition of a frame.
