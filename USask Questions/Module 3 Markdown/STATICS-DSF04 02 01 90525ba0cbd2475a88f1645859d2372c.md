Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a horizontal force, $P$, is acting on a two-member frame. Assume the reaction forces at supports $A$  and $B$ are $N_A$ and $N_B$, respectively. Given the slipping at the two supports does **NOT** occur simultaneously, which one of the following is the correct domain of the minimum value of $P$  that causes movement of the frame?

# Answer:

a. $P=(\mu_AN_a+\mu_BN_b)$

b. $P<(\mu_AN_a+\mu_BN_b)$

c. $P>(\mu_AN_a+\mu_BN_b)$

# Feedback:

### Specific feedback:

a. It is stated in the question that the slipping at the two supports does **NOT** occur simultaneously. This means one of the supports reaches impending motion first while the other one does not have impending motion. For example, if support $B$ is on the verge of moving while support $A$  is not, then the friction force at $B$  reaches the maximum static friction force, $F_{fB}=F_{sB}=\mu_BN_B$. But the friction force at $A$ should be less than the maximum static friction force. Thus, $F_{fA}<F_{sA}=\mu_AN_A$. In the end, due to the force equilibrium, $P=F_{fB}+F_{fA}$, which is **less** than $\mu_AN_a+\mu_BN_b$.

b. Good job! It is stated in the question that the slipping at the two supports does **NOT** occur simultaneously. This means one of the supports reaches impending motion first while the other one does not have impending motion. For example, if support $B$ is on the verge of moving while support $A$  is not, then the friction force at $B$  reaches the maximum static friction force, $F_{fB}=F_{sB}=\mu_BN_B$. But the friction force at $A$ should be less than the maximum static friction force. Thus, $F_{fA}<F_{sA}=\mu_AN_A$. In the end, due to the force equilibrium, $P=F_{fB}+F_{fA}$, which is **less** than $\mu_AN_a+\mu_BN_b$.
