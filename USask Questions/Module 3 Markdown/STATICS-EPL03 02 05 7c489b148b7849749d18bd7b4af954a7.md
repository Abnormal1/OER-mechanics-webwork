# Feedback:

a) This option shows the COG in the centre of the circular face of the plate ($x$ and $y$ direction), but it's located at the **top of the plate**. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a circular plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the face of the plate **as well as** the middle of the height ($z$ direction). 

b) This option shows the COG in the centre of the circular face of the plate ($x$ and $y$ direction), but it's located at the **bottom of the plate**. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a circular plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the face of the plate **as well as** the middle of the height ($z$ direction). 

c) Well done! This option shows the COG in the centre of the circular face and height of the plate. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a circular plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the face of the plate ($x$ and $y$ direction) as well as the middle of the height of the plate ($z$ direction). 

d) This option shows the COG in the correct position along the $y$ and $z$ directions, but not the $x$ direction. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a circular plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the face of the plate ($x$ and $y$ direction) as well as the middle of the height of the plate ($z$ direction).
