Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

Using the method of sections, if you want to find the force carried in member CD, how would you cut the truss?

# Feedback:

a. You need to cut across the member of interest.

b. In this way, you cut across too many members. Try not to go through more than 3 members.

c. Good job! This is the most appropriate way to cut the truss for solving $\bold{F_{CD}}$.

d. In this way, you cut across too many members. Try not to go through more than 3 members.
