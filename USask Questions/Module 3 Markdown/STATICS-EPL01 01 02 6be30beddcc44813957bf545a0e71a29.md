# Feedback:

a. The area under a uniform distributed loading (UDL) is a rectangle. The equivalent resultant force should act downwards passing through the centroid of that rectangle, which is located at 3 $\text{m}$ from the left end of the beam, **NOT** at the centre of the beam. 

b. Well done! The area under a uniform distributed loading (UDL) is a rectangle. The equivalent resultant force should act downwards passing through the centroid of that rectangle, which is located at 3 $\text{m}$ from the left end of the beam. 

c. The area under a uniform distributed loading (UDL) is a rectangle. The equivalent resultant force should act downwards passing through the centroid of that rectangle, which is located at 3 $\text{m}$ from the left end of the beam. 

d. The area under a uniform distributed loading (UDL) is a rectangle. The equivalent resultant force should act downwards passing through the centroid of that rectangle, which is located at 3 $\text{m}$ from the left end of the beam.
