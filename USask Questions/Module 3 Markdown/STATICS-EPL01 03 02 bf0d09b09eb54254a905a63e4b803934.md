# Feedback:

### Answer specific feedback:

a. This is one of the acceptable ways to convert a trapezoidal distributed load to its equivalent resultant loads. But this question is asking you to identify the **incorrect** way. The solution to this question is provided below.

b. This is one of the acceptable ways to convert a trapezoidal distributed load to its equivalent resultant loads. But this question is asking you to identify the **incorrect** way. The solution to this question is provided below.

c. This is one of the acceptable ways to convert a trapezoidal distributed load to its equivalent resultant loads. But this question is asking you to identify the **incorrect** way. The solution to this question is provided below.

d. Good job! This is the only option that shows an incorrect way to convert a trapezoidal distributed load to its equivalent resultant loads.  Break the distributed load into rectangles and triangles.

### General feedback:

The equivalent resultant force should go through the centroid of the area that describes the distributed loading. In this question, the area is a trapezoid. Instead of finding the centroid of the trapezoid, you can cut it into two simpler geometric pieces and find the centroid of each piece. 

Basically you have the choice of cut it into a rectangle and a triangle:

Or two triangles:
