# Question:

Consider the uniform rectangular plate in the diagram below:

![STATICS-EPL03%2002%2004%20b3ba483a864241b99f9dc96d433f6f52/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL03%2002%2004%20b3ba483a864241b99f9dc96d433f6f52/Untitled.png)

In the blanks below, enter the location of the **centre of gravity (COG)** of the plate in terms of length, width, and height (measuring from the origin of the coordinate system as shown).  Submit your answers in whole numbers:

Length ($x$ direction) = __________ mm

Width ($y$ direction) = __________ mm

Height ($z$ direction) = ___________ mm

# Answer:

Length ($x$ direction) = **72** mm

Width ($y$ direction) = **40** mm

Height ($z$ direction) = **9** mm

# Feedback:

For a uniform object, the centre of gravity (COG) is in the **geometric centre**. For a rectangular plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the length ($x$), width ($y$), and height ($z$). To find the distances to the COG, simply divide the full dimensions by 2 in each direction.
