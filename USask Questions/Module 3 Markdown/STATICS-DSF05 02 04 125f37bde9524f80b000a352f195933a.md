Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below, an external force $P$ is applied to the box. Given the weight of the box is $W$, and the box is moving at a constant velocity, determine the value of the kinetic coefficient of friction.

# Answer:

a. $\mu_s=\frac{P}{W}$

b. $\mu_k=\frac{P}{W}$

c. $\mu_s=\frac{W}{P}$

d. $\mu_k=\frac{W}{P}$

# Feedback:

### Answer specific feedback:

a. The expression $\frac{P}{W}$ is correct, however, $\mu_s$ represents the **static** coefficient of friction. In this case, the box is moving at a constant speed, so the correct notation for the kinetic coefficient of friction is $\mu_k$.

b. Good job! Since the object is in constant motion, $P$ is equal to the kinetic frictional force, i.e. $P=F_k=\mu_kW$. Therefore, $\mu_k=\frac{P}{W}$. 

c. Since the object is in constant motion, $P$ is equal to the kinetic frictional force, i.e. $P=F_k=\mu_kW$. Therefore, $\mu_k=\frac{P}{W}$. Also, $\mu_s$ represents the **static** coefficient of friction. The correct notation for the kinetic coefficient of friction is $\mu_k$.

d. Since the object is in constant motion, $P$ is equal to the kinetic frictional force, i.e. $P=F_k=\mu_kW$. Therefore, $\mu_k=\frac{P}{W}$.
