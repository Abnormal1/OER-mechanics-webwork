Topic/ Unit: Locate and calculate equivalent point loads for simple distributed 2D loads and centers of gravity (EPL)

# Question:

Do the distributed load and the point load cause the same moment effects on the beam? (i.e. cause the same moment about $A$ **and** cause the same moment about B?)

- [ ]  Yes
- [ ]  No

# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

For the beam on the left hand side subjected to a uniform distributed load or UDL, the UDL can be replaced by a $5~\text{kN/m}~(6~\text{m})=30~\text{kN}$ concentrated load located at $\frac{6~\text{m}}{2}=3~\text{m}$ from point $A$. Thus, the moment of the force about point $A$ is $M_A=90~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}\curvearrowright$, and the moment of the force about point $B$ is $M_B=210~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}\curvearrowleft$. 

For the beam on the right hand side with a point load, the moment of the force about point $A$ is $M_A=90~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}\curvearrowright$, which is the same as the moment caused by the distributed load. However, the moment of the force about point $B$ is $M_B=90~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}\curvearrowleft$, which is **different** from the the moment caused by the distributed load. 

Note that if a point load is the equivalent resultant force of a distributed load, then they would cause the same external effects (i.e. force and moment) at **every** support, not just one of them.
