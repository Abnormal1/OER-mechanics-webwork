Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

Which one of the following is the most appropriate procedure for the method of joints?

# Answer:

a. Find the easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Find the next easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Continue until all members are solved $\rightarrow$ Solve for ground reaction forces $\rightarrow$Last joint should be a check of your work

b. Solve for ground reaction forces $\rightarrow$ Find the easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Find the next easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Continue until all members are solved $\rightarrow$ Last joint should be a check of your work

c. Solve for ground reaction forces $\rightarrow$ Draw the FBD of the joint at the support$\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Draw the FBD of the joint next to the support $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Continue until all members are solved $\rightarrow$ Last joint should be a check of your work

# Feedback:

a. You might want to start by solving for the ground reaction forces. Then the joints at the supports are often (but not always) the easiest joints to solve. 

b. Well done! This is the most appropriate procedure for the method of joints. 

c. You should start with the easiest joint to solve. The joints at the supports are not always the easiest joints to solve.
