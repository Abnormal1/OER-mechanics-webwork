Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a non-zero horizontal force $P$ is applied to the crate. What would be the magnitude of the friction force, $F_f$, under each of the following circumstances?

1. No Impending Motion

a. $F_f=P$, and $P<F_s=\mu_sN$ 

2. Impending Motion

b. $F_f=P$, and $P=F_s=\mu_sN$, where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction between the contacting surfaces.

3. Constant Motion

c. $F_f=P$ and $P=F_k=\mu_kN$, where $\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction between the contacting surfaces.

# Answer:

1. - a.

2. - b.

3. - c.

# Feedback:

When the crate has no impending motion, we know that $P$ is smaller than the maximum static frictional force, $F_s$. To maintain the static equilibrium of the crate, the friction force should be equal to the applied horizontal force i.e. $F_f=P<F_s$.

As P is gradually increased, the friction force increases correspondingly until it reaches the maximum static frictional force, $F_s$, which is directly proportional to the resultant normal force and the coefficient of static friction, $\mu_s$. At this point, the crate is on the verge of moving but is still in equilibrium, which means $F_f=P$, and $P=F_s=\mu_sN$.

If the crate is in **constant** motion, then the crate is still in equilibrium (dynamic equilibrium). Thus, $F_f=P$. However, since the crate is in motion, and is not static, the friction force applied now is the kinetic friction force, $F_k$. Thus, when the crate is sliding at a constant velocity, $F_f=P$, and $P=F_k=\mu_kN$.
