Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below,  a non-zero horizontal force, $P$, is applied to the crate. If the crate is not moving and has no impending motion, then the friction force, $F_f$, acting on the crate is_______.

# Answer:

a. $F_f=\mu_sN$

b. $F_f<\mu_sN$

c. $F_f=0$

d. $F_f>\mu_sN$

# Feedback:

a. If the crate is on the verge of moving, then the friction force would equal to the maximum static friction force, $F_s=\mu_sN$. However, since the crate has no impending motion, the friction force $F_f$ should be less than $F_s$.

b. Well done! If the crate is on the verge of moving, then the friction force would equal the maximum static friction force, $F_s=\mu_sN$. However, since the crate has no impending motion, the friction force $F_f$ should be less than $F_s$.

c. If $P$ is not zero, then $F_f$ is not zero due to the force equilibrium in the horizontal direction.

d. Friction force will never be greater than the maximum static friction force. If the crate is on the verge of moving, then the friction force would equal the maximum static friction force, $F_s=\mu_sN$. However, since the crate has no impending motion, the friction force $F_f$ should be less than $F_s$.
