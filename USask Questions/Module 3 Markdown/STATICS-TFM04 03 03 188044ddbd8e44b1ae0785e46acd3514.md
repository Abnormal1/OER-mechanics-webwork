Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

Assume you decided to cut the truss as shown in the figure below, to employ the Method of Sections.  Which one of the following FBDs would be the easiest/fastest to use for solving the force in member CD? (assuming tension forces in all of the unknown members)

# Feedback:

a. The left section of the truss is associated with more unknowns and external forces.  Thus, it is easier to use the FBD of the right section for solving ${F_{DC}}$.

b. Well done! The left section of the truss is associated with more unknowns and external forces.  Thus, it is easier to use the FBD of the right section for solving ${F_{DC}}$.  In fact, you could solve for  ${F_{DC}}$ directly, using a moment about ${B}$.  Can you see what ${F_{DC}}$ would be?

c. You only need one of the two truss sections for solving ${F_{DC}}$.  Pick the one that has fewer unknowns and that will take fewer steps.
