Topic/ Unit: Locate and calculate equivalent point loads for simple distributed 2D loads and centers of gravity (EPL)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a beam is subjected to a distributed load. Determine the locations of the equivalent resultant forces. 

**Enter your answer:** 

$\text{d}_1=$ ________ m

$\text{d}_2=$ ________ m

# Answer:

$\text{d}_1=2~\text{m}$

$\text{d}_2=4~\text{m}$

# Feedback:

The equivalent resultant force should go through the centroid of the area that describes the distributed loading. For the triangular distributed load on the left-hand side, its equivalent resultant load is located at $\frac{2}{3}(3~\text{m})=2~\text{m}$ from the left end of the beam. For the triangular distributed load on the right-hand side, its equivalent resultant load is located at $\frac{2}{3}(6~\text{m})=4~\text{m}$ from the right end of the beam.
