# Question:

Consider the 2D representation of a human in the diagram below with the given centre of gravity (COG) and weight shown:

If the person has a mass of $57\,\mathrm{kg}$, what is the correct **magnitude** of the weight? Submit your answer to three significant figures:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=\,\_\_\_\_\_\,\mathrm{N}$$

# Answer:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=\underline\bold{559}\,\mathrm{N}$$

# Feedback:

To find the weight of an object, even a complex one, the mass must be multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity,  $g=9.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=m{g}$$

Remember that the standard unit of force & weight, $\mathrm{N}$, is a derived unit from the arrangement  $\mathrm{kg\cdot m/s^2}$.  Don't forget to round your answer to **three** significant digits!
