# Answer:

a. The frictional force is directly proportional to the resultant normal force.

b. The rougher the contacting surfaces, the higher the frictional forces. 

c. The frictional force is equal and opposite to the applied force $P$.

d. $P$ must be equal to or greater than the frictional force. 

# Feedback:

a. Good job! This is one of the correct statements. When the object is in motion, the frictional force is equal to the kinetic frictional force, $F_k$, which is directly proportional to the resultant normal force and the surface roughness. Also, the object is in equilibrium only if it's in **constant** motion. In other words, as long as the object is moving, then $F_f=F_k$. But $P$ may be less than, equal to, or greater than $F_f$, depending on whether the object's velocity is decreasing, increasing, or constant. 

b. Good job! This is one of the correct statements. When the object is in motion, the frictional force is equal to the kinetic frictional force, $F_k$, which is directly proportional to the resultant normal force and the surface roughness. Also, the object is in equilibrium only if it's in **constant** motion. In other words, as long as the object is moving, then $F_f=F_k$. But $P$ may be less than, equal to, or greater than $F_f$, depending on whether the object's acceleration is negative (decelerating), zero, or positive.

c. We only know that the object is in motion, but in fact, there could be three different circumstances: the object's velocity may be decreasing, increasing, or constant. The object is in equilibrium (i.e. $P=F_k$) only if it's in constant motion. When $P>F_k$, the object will speed up. When $P<F_k$, the object will slow down.

The object is in equilibrium (i.e. $P=F_k$) only if it's in constant motion. When $P>F_k$, the object will speed up. When $P<F_k$, the object will slow down.
