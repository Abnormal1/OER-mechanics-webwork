# Question:

Consider a uniform circular plate with diameter and thickness shown in the diagram below:

![STATICS-EPL03%2002%2006%2069561e0aff9b488b9ee3af9edab93e4c/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL03%2002%2006%2069561e0aff9b488b9ee3af9edab93e4c/Untitled.png)

In the blanks below, enter the location of the **centre of gravity (COG)** of the plate in terms of $x$, $y$, and $z$ dimensions (measuring from the origin of the coordinate system as shown).  Submit your answers with **two** significant figures:

$x_{COG}$ = __________ m

$y_{COG}$ = __________ m

$z_{COG}$ = ___________ m

# Answer:

$x_{COG}$ = **2.8** m

$y_{COG}$ = **2.8** m

$z_{COG}$ = **-0.50** m

# Feedback:

For a uniform object, the centre of gravity (COG) is in the **geometric centre**. For a circular plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the $x$, $y$, and $z$ dimensions. To find the distances to the COG, simply divide the diameter ($x$ and $y$)  and thickness ($z$) each by 2. 

Remember to round your answer to **two** significant figures!
