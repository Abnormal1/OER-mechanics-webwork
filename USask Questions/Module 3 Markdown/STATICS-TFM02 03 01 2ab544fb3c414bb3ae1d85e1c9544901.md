Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

From the options below, select the correct FBD of joint $A$. You can either assume the members are in compression or in tension.

d. No FBD needs to be constructed, because member AD and AC are ZFMs.

# Feedback:

a. The 100 $\text{N}$ external force is missing in this FBD.

b. Well done! This is the correct FBD for joint $A$.

c. This is the FBD for joint $B$, however, the question is asking for the FBD for joint $A$.

d. Members AD and AC are not ZFMs. Although these two members are not collinear, there is an external force applied to this joint. Thus, they are not ZFMs.
