Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a horizontal force is pushing an object moving to the right. Which one of the following statements is **incorrect** about dry friction involving motion?

# Answer:

a. The object is not in equilibrium if it's accelerating, and $P>F_k=\mu_kN$

b. The object is in equilibrium if it's in constant motion, and $P=F_k=\mu_kN$.

c. The object is not in equilibrium if it's decelerating, and $P<F_k=\mu_kN$

d. The object is always in equilibrium independent of the type of motion, and $P=F_k=\mu_kN$.

# Feedback:

a. This statement is correct. However, this question is asking you to identify the incorrect one. The object is in equilibrium if it's in constant motion. Thus, based on force equilibrium, the external applied force, $P$, should be equal and opposite to the kinetic frictional force, $F_k=\mu_kN$. When $P$  is bigger than $F_k$, the object accelerates. When $P$ is smaller than $F_k$, the object decelerates.

b. This statement is correct. However, this question is asking you to identify the incorrect one. The object is in equilibrium if it's in constant motion. Thus, based on force equilibrium, the external applied force, $P$, should be equal and opposite to the kinetic frictional force, $F_k=\mu_kN$. When $P$  is bigger than $F_k$, the object accelerates. When $P$ is smaller than $F_k$, the object decelerates.

c. This statement is correct. However, this question is asking you to identify the incorrect one. The object is in equilibrium if it's in constant motion. Thus, based on force equilibrium, the external applied force, $P$, should be equal and opposite to the kinetic frictional force, $F_k=\mu_kN$. When $P$  is bigger than $F_k$, the object accelerates. When $P$ is smaller than $F_k$, the object decelerates.

d. Good job! This statement is incorrect. The object is in dynamic equilibrium **only** when it's in **constant** motion.
