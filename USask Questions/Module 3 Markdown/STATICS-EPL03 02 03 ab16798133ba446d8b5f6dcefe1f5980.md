# Feedback:

a) This option shows the COG in the centre of the length ($y$ direction) and width ($x$ direction) of the plate, but it's located at the **top of the plate** ($z=3\,\mathrm{m}$). For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a rectangular plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the face of the plate ($x$ and $y$ direction) **as well as** the middle of the height ($z$ direction). 

b) This option shows the COG in the middle of the height of the plate ($z=1.5\,\mathrm{cm}$), but at the edges of the length and width. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a rectangular plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the height ($z$ direction) **as well as** the middle of the face of the plate ($x$ and $y$ direction). 

c) Close! The diagram in this option represents the COG well, but the values given are not accurate. Remember that for a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a rectangular plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in halfway along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ dimensions. 

d) Good job! This option shows the COG in the centre of the length ($y$ direction), width ($x$ direction), and height ($z$ direction) of the plate. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a rectangular plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the face of the plate ($x$ and $y$ direction) as well as the middle of the height of the plate ($z$ direction).
