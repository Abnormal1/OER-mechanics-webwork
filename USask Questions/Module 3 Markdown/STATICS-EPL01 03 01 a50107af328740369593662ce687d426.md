# Feedback:

a. Well done! The equivalent resultant force should go through the centroid of the area that describes the distributed loading. In this question, the area is made up of two rectangles, and the centroid of a rectangle is located at its center. Thus, the equivalent resultant force due to $w_1$ is located at $\frac{6~\text{m}}{2}=3~\text{m}$ from the **left** end of the beam. And the equivalent resultant force due to $w_2$ is located at $\frac{4~\text{m}}{2}=2~\text{m}$ from the **right** end of the beam.
