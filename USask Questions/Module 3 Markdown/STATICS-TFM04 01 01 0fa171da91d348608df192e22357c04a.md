Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

Which one of the following is the most appropriate procedure for the Method of Sections?

# Answer:

a. Solve for ground support reactions $\rightarrow$ Draw the FBD of the truss $\rightarrow$ use three equilibrium equations to solve for unknown forces 

b. Decide how to cut the truss through the members of interest $\rightarrow$ Solve for ground support reactions $\rightarrow$ Draw the FBD of one of the two truss parts $\rightarrow$ use three equilibrium equations to solve for unknown forces 

c. Solve for ground reaction forces $\rightarrow$ Find the easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Find the next easiest joint to solve $\rightarrow$ Solve it $\rightarrow$ Continue until all members are solved $\rightarrow$ Last joint should be a check of your work

# Feedback:

a. The procedure described in this option is not for the method of sections. For the method of sections, you need to cut the truss across the members of interest to solve for the members' internal forces. 

 b. Good job! This is the most appropriate procedure for the method of sections. 

c. This is the procedure for the method of joints, not for the method of sections.
