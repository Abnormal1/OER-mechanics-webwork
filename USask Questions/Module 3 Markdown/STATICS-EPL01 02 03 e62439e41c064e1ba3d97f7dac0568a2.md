# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a bulkhead is subjected to water pressure. Knowing the water pressure increases linearly with the depth measured from the water's surface, determine the location of the equivalent resultant force. 

**Enter your answer:** $d=$ ________ m.

# Answer:

0.6

# Feedback:

The equivalent resultant force should go through the centroid of the area that describes the distributed loading. For a triangular distributed load, its equivalent resultant load is located at 1/3 of the distance from the larger end. Thus, $d=\frac{1.8~\text{m}}{3}=0.6~\text{m}$.
