# Question:

Consider the symmetrical outline of a holiday tree below, where our assumption of symmetry covers both the shape and the density of the two sides:

![STATICS-EPL03%2003%2002%2048acfb26ac5346c8917e4fd5b14a48d3/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL03%2003%2002%2048acfb26ac5346c8917e4fd5b14a48d3/Untitled.png)

In the blank below, enter the $x$ coordinate of the position of the **centre of gravity (COG)** of the object. Submit your answer as a whole number chosen from the $x$ axis:

${x}=\,\_\_\_\_$

# Answer:

${x}=\underline\bold{4}$

# Feedback:

Although we don't know the exact location vertically of the COG, we do know it is on the **symmetrical midline** of a complex symmetrical shape such as the one above. The midline of the symmetrical tree shown in this problem is a vertical line starting at the centre of the trunk at the bottom and finishing through the centre of the star at the top.
