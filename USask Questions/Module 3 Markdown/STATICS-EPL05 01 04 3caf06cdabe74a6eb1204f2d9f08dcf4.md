# Answer:

Yes

# Feedback:

The point load in the right-hand diagram is the equivalent resultant force of the uniform distributed load in the left-hand diagram (i.e. equal magnitude and right location). Thus, they must cause the same external effects (i.e. force and moment) at the support at point $A$.
