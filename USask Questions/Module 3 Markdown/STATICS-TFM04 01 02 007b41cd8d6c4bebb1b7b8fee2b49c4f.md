Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

Which one of the following is the most appropriate procedure for the Method of Sections?

# Answer:

a. Decide how to cut the truss through the members of interest $\rightarrow$ Solve for ground support reactions, as needed $\rightarrow$ Draw the FBD of one of the two truss parts $\rightarrow$ use three equilibrium equations to solve for unknown forces 

b. Cut the truss in half $\rightarrow$ Solve for ground support reactions $\rightarrow$ Draw the FBD of one of the two truss parts $\rightarrow$ use three equilibrium equations to solve for unknown forces 

c. Decide how to cut the truss through the members of interest $\rightarrow$ Solve for ground support reactions, as needed $\rightarrow$ Draw the FBD of both truss parts $\rightarrow$ use three equilibrium equations to solve for unknown forces 

# Feedback:

a. Good job! This is the most appropriate procedure for the Method of Sections. 

b. At the start, it is important to take a minute to think about how to cut the truss. You need to cut across the the members of interest while introducing the least number of unknowns (no more than 3). So it's not simply cutting the truss in half. 

c. You only need to solve one of the two truss sections, because the forces common to the two FBDs are equal and opposite.
