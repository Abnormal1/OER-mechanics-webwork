Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

Which one of the following describes the right procedure for solving frames?

# Answer:

a. Disassemble the structure and draw the FBD of each part$\rightarrow{}$Identify all 2FMs and represent the two forces acting on them in equal but **opposite collinear** directions $\rightarrow{}$Forces common to two FBDs are equal and in the **same direction**

b. Disassemble the structure and draw the FBD of each part$\rightarrow{}$Identify all 2FMs and represent the two forces acting on them in equal but **opposite collinear** directions $\rightarrow{}$Forces common to two FBDs are equal and **opposite**

c. Disassemble the structure and draw the FBD of each part$\rightarrow{}$Identify all 2FMs and represent the two forces acting on them in the same **collinear** directions $\rightarrow{}$Forces common to two FBDs are equal and **opposite**

# Feedback:

a. Forces common to two FBDs are equal and **opposite in direction**.  

b. Good job! This is the most appropriate procedure for solving frames. 

c. The two forces acting on a 2FM should be equal and in **opposite collinear directions.**
