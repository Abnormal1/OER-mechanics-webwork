# Feedback:

a) This option shows the COG in the centre of the circular cross section of the rod ($x$ and $z$ direction), but not in the horizontal centre ($y$ direction). For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a cylindrical rod in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the length ($y$ direction) as well as the centre of the cross section ($x$ and $z$ direction). 

b) This option shows the COG in the horizontal centre of the rod ($y$ direction), but not in the centre of the height or depth ($x$ and $z$ direction). For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a cylindrical rod in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the length ($y$ direction) as well as the centre of the cross section ($x$ and $z$ direction). 

c) This option shows the COG in the horizontal centre of the rod ($y$ direction), and in the centre of the height ($z$ direction), but not the depth ($x$ direction) since it is given that it is on the surface. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a cylindrical rod in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the length ($y$ direction) as well as the centre of the cross section ($x$ and $z$ direction). 

d) Correct! This option shows the COG in the centre of the length ($y$ direction), height ($z$ direction), and depth ($x$ direction) of the rod. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a cylindrical rod in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the length ($y$ direction) as well as the centre of the cross section ($x$ and $z$ direction).
