Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

A box is sliding down an inclined plane as shown in the figure below. Assume the box's weight is $W~\text{lb}$ , determine the magnitude of the friction force.

# Answer:

a. $F_f=F_s=\mu_s(W\cos\theta)$

b. $F_f=F_k=\mu_k(W\cos\theta)$

c. $F_f=W\sin\theta$

# Feedback:

a. The box is moving, not at rest. Thus, you should use the coefficient of **kinetic** friction $\mu_k$, instead of the coefficient of **static** friction, $\mu_s$.

b. Well done! This is the correct equation to find the kinetic friction force.

c. This equation calculates the component of the weight along the inclined surface. It would be equal to the kinetic friction force if the box is moving at a **constant** velocity. However, since we do not know if the box is moving at a constant velocity, we can not assume these two are equal. In fact, independent of whether the box is accelerating, decelerating, or moving at a constant velocity, the kinetic friction force stays the same: $F_k=\mu_kN=\mu_k(W\cos\theta)$.
