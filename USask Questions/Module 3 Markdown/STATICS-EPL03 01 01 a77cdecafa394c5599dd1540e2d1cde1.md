# Feedback:

a) This option shows the COG in the horizontal centre of the beam ($x$ direction), but not in the vertical centre ($y$ direction). For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a beam in 2D (a rectangle), this means the COG is located in the middle of the length and the width. 

b) Correct! This option shows the COG in the horizontal centre ($x$ direction) and the vertical centre ($y$ direction) of the beam. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a beam in 2D (a rectangle), this means the COG is located in the middle of the length and the width. 

c) This option shows the COG in the vertical centre ($y$ direction) of the beam, but not in the horizontal centre ($x$ direction). For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a beam in 2D (a rectangle), this means the COG is located in the middle of the length and the width.
