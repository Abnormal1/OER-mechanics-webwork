# Question:

Consider the uniform square plate in the diagram below with the given centre of gravity (COG) and force due to gravity (or weight) shown:

![STATICS-EPL04%2002%2001%20fdaacd3ab50c4bd1af1ba85d530c7624/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL04%2002%2001%20fdaacd3ab50c4bd1af1ba85d530c7624/Untitled.png)

If the plate has an area mass density of $0.75\,\mathrm{slugs/ft^2}$, what is the correct **magnitude** of the force due to gravity (or weight)? Submit your answer to three significant figures:

$$|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=\,\_\_\_\_\_\times10^3 \,\,\mathrm{lb}$$

# Answer:

$$|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=\underline\bold{24.7}\times10^3 \,\,\mathrm{lb}$$

# Feedback:

This problem is in imperial units. A **slug** is the imperial unit of mass, and it has a weight of approximately $32.2\,\mathrm{lb}$ in standard Earth gravity.  Acceleration due to gravity is $32.2\,\mathrm{ft/s^2}$ in imperial units, and force is measured in $\mathrm{lbs}$. 

When an **area mass density** is given (in $\mathrm{slugs/ft^2}$), it must be multiplied by the area of the surface of the plate to find the actual mass of the object (and the dimensions must match!):

$$m_\mathrm{plate}= 0.75\,\mathrm{slugs/ft^2}(32\,\mathrm{ft}\times32\,\mathrm{ft})$$

Then, the mass of the plate, $m_\mathrm{plate}$, can be multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity,  $g=32.2\,\mathrm{ft/s^2}$, to get the magnitude of the weight, or the force due to gravity:

$$|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=m_\mathrm{plate}{g}$$

Don't forget to round your answer to **three** significant digits!
