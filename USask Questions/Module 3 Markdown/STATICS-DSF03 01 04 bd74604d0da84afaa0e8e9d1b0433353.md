Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

When acting alone, which force is most likely to move the object?

# Answer:

a. $P_1$

b. $P_2$

c. $P_3$

d.  All three forces are equally likely to move the object, because their horizontal components are equal.

# Feedback:

a. Good job! Even though all three forces have the same horizontal components, the other two forces also have vertical components, which results in higher resultant normal forces and higher maximum static frictional forces. 

b. Even though all three forces have the same horizontal components, $P_2$ and $P_3$ also have vertical components, which results in higher resultant normal forces and higher maximum static frictional forces. 

c. Even though all three forces have the same horizontal components, $P_2$ and $P_3$ also have vertical components, which results in higher resultant normal forces and higher maximum static frictional forces. 

d. Even though all three forces have the same horizontal components, $P_2$ and $P_3$ also have vertical components, which results in higher resultant normal forces and higher maximum static frictional forces.
