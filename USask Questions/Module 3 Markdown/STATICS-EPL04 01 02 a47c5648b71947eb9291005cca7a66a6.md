# Question:

Consider the uniform beam in the diagram below with the given centre of gravity (COG) and weight shown:

![STATICS-EPL04%2001%2002%20a47c5648b71947eb9291005cca7a66a6/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL04%2001%2002%20a47c5648b71947eb9291005cca7a66a6/Untitled.png)

If the beam has a linear mass density of $3.3\,\mathrm{kg/m}$, what is the correct **magnitude** of the weight (force due to gravity)? Submit your answer to three significant figures:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=\,\_\_\_\_\_\,\mathrm{N}$$

# Answer:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=\underline\bold{113}\,\mathrm{N}$$

# Feedback:

When a **linear mass density** is given (in $\mathrm{kg/m}$), it must be multipled by the length of the beam to find the actual mass of the object (and the dimensions must match!):

$$m_\mathrm{beam}= 3.3\,\mathrm{kg/m}(3.5\,\mathrm{m})$$

Then, the mass of the beam, $m_\mathrm{beam}$, can be multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity,  $g=9.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$, to get the magnitude of the weight, or the force due to gravity:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=m_\mathrm{beam}{g}$$

Remember that the standard unit of force & weight, $\mathrm{N}$, is a derived unit from the arrangement  $\mathrm{kg\cdot m/s^2}$.  Don't forget to round your answer to three significant digits!
