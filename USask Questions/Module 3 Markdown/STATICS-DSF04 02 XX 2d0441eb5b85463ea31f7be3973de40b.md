Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below, block $B$ is sitting on a surface and block $A$   is sitting on block $B$. If bock $A$ weighs 200 $\text{N}$, and block $B$ weighs 100 $\text{N}$, which one of the following equations can be used to calculate the maximums static friction froce at the bottom of block $B$.

# Answer:

a. $F_s=\mu_{s1}(W_A+W_B)=0.3(200~\text{N}+100~\text{N})$

b. $F_s=\mu_{s2}(W_A+W_B)=0.1(200~\text{N}+100~\text{N})$

c. $F_s=\mu_{s2}W_B=0.1(100~\text{N})$

d. $F_s=\mu_{s1}W_A=0.3(200~\text{N})$

# Feedback:

### Specific feedback:

a. $\mu_{s2}$ should be used instead of $\mu_{s1}$. See below for the solution of this question.

b. Well done! See below for the solution of this question. 

c. The reaction force provided by the surface should be the sum of the weight of the two blocks. See below for the solution of this question.

d. This answer calculates the maximum static friction force at the bottom of block $A$, not block $B$. See below for the solution of this question.

### General feedback:

See the FBD of block $B$ below:

Thus, the maximum static frction force at the bottom of block $B$ is:

$$F_{s2}=\mu_{s2}N_B=\mu_{s2}(W_A+W_B)=0.1(300~\text{N})$$
