# Question:

Consider the uniform beam in the diagram below:

![STATICS-EPL03%2001%2002%20739b9049d37849c4b012ce7171ac766d/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL03%2001%2002%20739b9049d37849c4b012ce7171ac766d/Untitled.png)

In the blanks below, enter the location of the **centre of gravity (COG)** of the beam in terms of length & width (submit your answer to 2 decimal places):

Length (to COG) = __________ ft

Width (to COG) = ___________ ft

# Answer:

Length (to COG) = **1.75** ft

Width (to COG) = **0.15** ft

# Feedback:

For a uniform object, the centre of gravity (COG) is in the **geometric centre**. For a beam in 2D (a rectangle), this means the COG is located in the middle of the length and the width. To find the length to the COG, simply divide the full length by 2, and similarly for width.
