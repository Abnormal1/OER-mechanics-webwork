# Question:

Given $w_1=[A]~\text{kN/m}$ and $w_2=[B]~\text{kN/m}$, determine the magnitude of the equivalent resultant forces due to $w_1$ and $w_2$. 

**Enter your answer:** 

Equivalent resultant force due to $w_1$:  _____ $\text{kN}$

Equivalent resultant force due to $w_2$:  _____ $\text{kN}$

### **Variable Parameters**

$[A]:$ Range (3, 5), in steps of 1

$[B]:$ Range (6, 8), in steps of 1

$[C]:[C]=6\times[A]$ 

$[D]:[D]=4\times[B]$ 

# Answer:

$[C],[D]$

# Feedback:

The magnitude of the equivalent resultant force is equal to the area under the loading diagram. In this question, the area is made up of two rectangles. Thus, the magnitude of the equivalent resultant force due to $w_1$ can be calculated as the area of the rectangle on the **left** hand side: $[A]~\text{kN/m}~(6~\text{m})=[C]~\text{kN}$. The magnitude of the equivalent resultant force due to $w_2$ can be calculated as the area of the rectangle on the **right** hand side: $[B]~\text{kN/m}~(4~\text{m})=[D]~\text{kN}$.
