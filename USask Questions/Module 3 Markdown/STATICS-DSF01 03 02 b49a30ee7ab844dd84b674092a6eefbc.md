# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a moving car is trying to stop in front of the red light. In what direction is the force of friction from the road acting on the tires?

a. to the right

b. to the left

# Feedback:

a. During braking, the tires rotate at a slower rate, or even stop rotating if you slam on the brakes. Thus the tires are slipping to the right, and the friction force should be directed to the left. We can solve this problem in another way. It is the road friction force that slows down the car during braking, thus the direction of friction must be opposing the motion of the car which is still to the right during the period of braking. 

b. Well done! During braking, the tires rotate at a slower rate, or even stop rotating if you slam on the brakes. Thus the tires are slipping to the right, and the friction force should be directed to the left. We can solve this problem in another way.
