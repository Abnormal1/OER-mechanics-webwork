Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

If you want to calculate the force in member CD, would you use the method of joints or the method of sections?

# Answer:

a. Method of joints

b. Method of sections

c. They are equally efficient. 

# Feedback:

a. When solving for only **a few** members in a truss,  the method of sections is more efficient. In this example, $\bold{F_{CD}}$ can be solved in one step using the method of sections. But it will take multiple steps to move from joint to joint if the method of joints is used. 

b. Well done. When solving for only **a few** members in a truss,  the method of sections is more suitable. In this example, $\bold{F_{CD}}$ can be solved in one step using the method of sections. But it will take multiple steps to move from joint to joint if the method of joints is used.
