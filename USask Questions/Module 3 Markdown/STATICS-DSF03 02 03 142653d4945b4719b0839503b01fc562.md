Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

A box with a weight of $[C]~\text{N}$ is sitting on a surface, at rest. Then two forces, $P_1$ and $P_2$, are applied to the box.  Given $P_1=[S]~\text{N}$ and $P_2=[B]~\text{N}$, determine if the box remains in equilibrium, and what is the value of the frictional force?

### **Variable Parameters**

$[B]:$ Range (10, 20), in steps of 1

$[C]:$ Range (10, 20), in steps of 1

$[S]:[S]=0.3\times([B]+[C])$

$[K]:[K]=0.24\times([B]+[C])$

 

# Answer:

a. The object remains in equilibrium, and the frictional force is 0 $\text{N}$.

b. The object remains in equilibrium, and the frictional force is $[S]~\text{N}$.

c. The object is no longer in equilibrium, and the frictional force is $[S]~\text{N}$.

d. The object is no longer in equilibrium, and the frictional force is$[K]~\text{N}$.

# Feedback:

### Answer specific feedback:

a. $P_1$ is not zero, thus there must be a frictional force resisting the motion or the tendency to move of the object. See below for the solution of this question. 

b. Well done! $P_1$ is equal to the maximum static frictional force. So the object is on the verge of moving but is still in equilibrium. Thus, $F_f=F_s=P_1=[S]~\text{N}$. See below for the solution of this question. 

c.   $P_1$ is equal to the maximum static frictional force. So the object is on the verge of moving but is still in equilibrium. Thus, $F_f=F_s=P_1=[S]~\text{N}$. See below for the solution of this question. 

d.  $P_1$ is equal to the maximum static frictional force. So the object is on the verge of moving but is still in equilibrium. Thus, $F_f=F_s=P_1=[S]~\text{N}$. See below for the solution of this question. 

### General feedback:

First, we need to calculate the maximum static frictional force and compare it with $P_1$. 

$$F_s=\mu_s(W+P_2)=[S]~\text{kN}~=~P_1$$

Therefore, the object is on the verge of moving but is still in equilibrium. The frictional force is $[S]~\text{N}$.
