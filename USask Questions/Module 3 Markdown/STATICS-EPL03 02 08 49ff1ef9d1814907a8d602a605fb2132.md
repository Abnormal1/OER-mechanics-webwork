# Question:

Consider a uniform triangular plate in the diagram below, depicting a right triangle with its $90^\circ$ angle in the bottom left-hand corner:

![STATICS-EPL03%2002%2008%2049ff1ef9d1814907a8d602a605fb2132/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL03%2002%2008%2049ff1ef9d1814907a8d602a605fb2132/Untitled.png)

In the blanks below, enter the location of the **centre of gravity (COG)** of the plate in terms of **magnitudes** of the distances labeled on the diagram.  Submit your answers to **one decimal place**:

$x_{COG}$ = __________ $\mathrm{m}$

$y_{COG}$ = __________ $\mathrm{m}$

$z_{COG}$ = ___________ $\mathrm{m}$

# Answer:

$x_{COG}=\underline\bold{1.0}\,\mathrm{m}$

$y_{COG}=\underline\bold{2.1}\,\mathrm{m}$

$z_{COG}=\underline\bold{0.1}\,\mathrm{m}$

# Feedback:

For a uniform object, the centre of gravity (COG) is in the **geometric centre**. The geometric centre of a **right triangle** is one-third of the way along the two sides that are NOT the hypotenuse, always going from the thick end of the triangle to the thin/pointy end. Because this is a triangular plate, the COG is also located in the middle of the plate ($z$ direction). To find the distances to the COG, simply divide the base and height ($x$ and $y$) by 3 and thickness ($z$) by 2. 

Remember to submit your answer to **one decimal place**.
