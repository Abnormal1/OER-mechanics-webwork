Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

In which one of the following situations would you definitely choose to use the Method of Joints over the Method of Sections?

# Answer:

a. The truss only has a few joints.

b. You are only interested in the forces in a few members.

c. You want to know the forces in all of the members. 

d. It is a bridge truss.

# Feedback:

a. The best method is chosen based on the number of members that you are solving for, not on how many joints the truss has in total. 

b. Usually the Method of Sections is more efficient when you are only solving for a few members of a truss. 

c. Good job! The Method of Joints is used when you are solving for the forces in all of the members. 

d. The type of the truss is irrelevant to which method you would use to solve it.  Instead, the choice depends on whether you are solving for just a few or all of the members.
