Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

Which one of the following statements is correct about dry friction involving impending motion at **some** points of contact?

# Answer:

a. The number of unknowns will be **less than** the number of available equations (equilibrium equations plus friction equations or tipping equations)

b. The number of unknowns will be **equal to** the number of available equations (equilibrium equations plus friction equations or tipping equations)

c. The number of unknowns will be **more than** the number of available equations (equilibrium equations plus friction equations or tipping equations)

# Feedback:

a. Good job! In this case, the number of unknowns will be **less than** the number of available equations. Thus, there is more than one possibility for impending motion. You will need to determine which kind of motion actually occurs.

b. In this case, the number of unknowns will be **less than** the number of available equations. Thus, there is more than one possibility for impending motion. You will need to determine which kind of motion actually occurs.

c. In this case, the number of unknowns will be **less than** the number of available equations. Thus, there is more than one possibility for impending motion. You will need to determine which kind of motion actually occurs.
