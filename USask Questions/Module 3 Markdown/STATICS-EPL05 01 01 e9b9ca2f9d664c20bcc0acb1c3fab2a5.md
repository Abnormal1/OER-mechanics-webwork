# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

For the beam on the left hand side subjected to a uniform distributed load or UDL, the UDL can be replaced by a $3~\text{kN/m}~(3~\text{m})=9~\text{kN}$ concentrated load located at $2+\frac{3~\text{m}}{2}=3.5~\text{m}$ from point $A$. Thus, based on force and moment equilibriums, we can find the moment reaction at $A$: $M_A=31.5~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}\curvearrowleft$.

For the beam on the right hand side with a point load, although the magnitude of the force is equivalent to the distributed load on the left hand side, the moment arm is **different**. So the moment reaction at $A$ caused by the point load is $M_A=27~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}\curvearrowleft$.

Note that if a point load is the equivalent resultant force of a distributed load, then they would cause the same external effects (i.e. force and moment reactions) at the support(s).
