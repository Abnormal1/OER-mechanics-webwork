# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a beam is subjected to a uniform distributed load. Given $w_1=[A]~\text{kN/m}$, determine the magnitude of the equivalent resultant force.

**Enter your answer:** 

The magnitude of the equivalent resultant force =  _____ $\text{kN}$

### **Variable Parameters**

$[A]:$ Range (3, 10), in steps of 1

$[C]:[C]=9\times[A]$ 

# Answer:

$[C]$

# Feedback:

To find the magnitude of the equivalent resultant force of a uniform distributed load, you can simply use the intensity of the UDL times its loading length. Thus, for this question:

$$‚Åç$$

Note that the magnitude of the equivalent resultant force is equal to the area of the shape that describes the distributed loading. The formula above can be understood as the area formula for a rectangle.
