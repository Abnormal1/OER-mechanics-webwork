Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

What is the relationship between the kinetic frictional force $F_k$ and the maximum static frictional force $F_s$?

# Answer:

a. $F_k<F_s$

b. $F_k=F_s$

c. $F_k>F_s$

# Feedback:

a. Well done! The maximum static frictional force is greater than the kinetic frictional force for the same object. This is due to the fact that during motion the object is considered to be "riding" on the tips of the contact points, instead of being interlocked. 

b. The maximum static frictional force is greater than the kinetic frictional force for the same object. This is due to the fact that during motion the object is considered to be "riding" on the tips of the contact points, instead of being interlocked.
