Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

A horizontal force, $P$, is acting on a block sitting on the ground at rest. Determine the magnitude of the force $P$ to cause impending motion of the block.

# Answer:

a. $P=\mu_sN$

b. $P=\mu_kN$

c. $P\le\mu_sN$

d. $\mu_kN\le P\le\mu_sN$

# Feedback:

a. Good job! Impending motion refers to the moment when the block is on the verge of moving. Here, the static friction force reaches its maximum.  $P=F_s=\mu_sN$, where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction.

b. $\mu_k$ is called the coefficient of **kinetic** friction, which is used to calculate the friction force when the crate is sliding on the ground.  Impending motion refers to the moment when the block is on the verge of moving.  Here, the static friction force reaches its maximum.  $P=F_s=\mu_sN$, where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of **static** friction.

c. Impending motion refers to the moment when the block is on the verge of moving. Here, the static friction force reaches its maximum.  $P=F_s=\mu_sN$, where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction.

d. Impending motion refers to the moment when the block is on the verge of moving. Here, the static friction force reaches its maximum.  $P=F_s=\mu_sN$, where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction.
