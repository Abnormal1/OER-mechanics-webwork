# Answer:

3.5

# Feedback:

The equivalent resultant force should act at the centroid of the area under the distributed loading. For a rectangular uniform distributed load (UDL), its equivalent resultant load is located at the center of the rectangle. Thus, $d=2~\text{m}+\frac{3~\text{m}}{2}=3.5~\text{m}$.
