Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

Assume you decided to cut the truss as shown in the figure below, to employ the Method of Sections.  What would the FBDs of the two truss parts look like? (assuming tension forces in all of the unknown members)

# Feedback:

a. Don't forget your support reactions.

b. Well done! The FBDs for both truss parts are correct.

c. Forces common to two FBDs should be equal and **opposite**. 

d. As mentioned in the question, you should assume the unknown members are in tension. The members shown in this FBD are in compression.
