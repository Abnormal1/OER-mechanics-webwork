# Question:

A four-wheel drive car is moving to the right with an accelerating speed. In what direction is the force of friction from the road acting on the tires?

a. to the right

b. to the left

a. Good job! Let's take a closer look at the tires. Although the car is moving to the right, the tires are rotating CW and pushing the ground to the left (since the car is accelerating). Thus the friction force should oppose the direction the tires are pushing. We can also approach this question in another way. Friction is the only force acting on the car in the horizonal direction. It is the cause of the acceleration of the car. Thus, the friction force must be in the same direction as the acceleration of the car.  This is an example of what is called "driving friction".
