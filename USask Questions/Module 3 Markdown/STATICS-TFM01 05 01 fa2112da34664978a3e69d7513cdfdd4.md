# Answer:

No

# Feedback:

A structure is considered statically indeterminate if it has more supports than necessary to hold it in equilibrium. Here, a pin and a roller would be sufficient to hold this truss in equilibrium. A pin support is associated with two unknowns ($\text{F}_x$ and $\text{F}_y)$ and a roller support is associated with only one unknown ($\text{F}_y$). Thus, two pin supports provide one extra unknown, which results in static indeterminacy.
