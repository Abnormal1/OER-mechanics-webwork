Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

A box with a weight of $[C]~\text{N}$ is sitting on a surface, at rest. Then two forces, $P_1$ and $P_2$, are applied to the box.  Given $P_1=[A]~\text{N}$ and $P_2=[B]~\text{N}$, determine if the box remains in equilibrium, and what is the value of the frictional force, $F_f$?

### **Variable Parameters**

$[A]:$ Range (10, 15), in steps of 1

$[B]:$ Range (5, 10), in steps of 1

$[C]:$ Range (11, 15), in steps of 1

$[S]:[S]=0.3\times([B]+[C])$

$[K]:[K]=0.24\times([B]+[C])$

 

# Answer:

a. The object remains in equilibrium, $F_f=0~\text{N}$.

b. The object remains in equilibrium,  $F_f=[A]~\text{N}$.

c. The object remains in equilibrium, $F_f=[S]~\text{N}$.

d. The object is no longer in equilibrium, $F_f=[K]~\text{N}$.

# Feedback:

### Answer specific feedback:

a. $P_1$ is not zero, thus there must be a frictional force resisting the motion or the tendency to move of the object. See below for the solution of this question. 

b. $P_1$ is greater than the maximum static frictional force. Thus, the object is no longer in equilibrium, and the frictional force is equal to kinetic frictional force. See below for the solution of this question. 

c. $P_1$ is greater than the maximum static frictional force. Thus, the object is no longer in equilibrium, and the frictional force is equal to kinetic frictional force. See below for the solution of this question. 

d. Good job! $P_1$ is greater than the maximum static frictional force. Thus, the object is no longer in equilibrium, and the frictional force is equal to kinetic frictional force. See below for the solution of this question. 

### General feedback:

First, we need to calculate the maximum static frictional force and compare it with $P_1$. 

$$F_s=\mu_s(W+P_2)=0.3([C]+[B])=[S]~\text{kN}~<~P_1$$

Therefore, the object is no longer in equilibrium and will start moving. The frictional force is equal to the kinetic frictional force, $F_k$:

$$F_k=\mu_k(W+P_2)=0.24([C]+[B])=[K]~\text{N}$$
