Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a vertical force $P$ is acting on an object at rest. Assume the object has  a weight, $W$. What is the value of the frictional force?

# Answer:

a. 0

b. $P$

c. $\mu_s(W+P)$

d. $\mu_sP$

# Feedback:

a. Good job! The object is at rest, and there is no force trying to move the object. Thus, the frictional force is zero.

b. $P$ is directed downwards, so it does not cause the object to move horizontally. The object is at rest, and there is no force trying to move the object parallel to the surface. Thus, the frictional force is zero. 

c. Both $W$ and $P$ are directed downwards, so they do not cause the object to move horizontally. The object is at rest, and there is no force trying to move the object parallel to the surface. Thus, the frictional force is zero. 

d. $P$ is directed downwards, so it does not cause the object to move horizontally. The object is at rest, and there is no force trying to move the object parallel to the surface. Thus, the frictional force is zero.
