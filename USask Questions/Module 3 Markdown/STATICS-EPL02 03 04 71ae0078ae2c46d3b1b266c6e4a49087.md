# Question:

A beam is subjected to a trapezoidal distributed load. Assume $w_1=[A]~\text{kN/m}$ and  $w_2=[B]~\text{kN/m}$ . If the trapezoidal loading is divided into two triangles as shown in the bottom figure, determine the magnitudes of the equivalent resultant forces, $\text{P}_1$ and $\text{P}_2$.

**Enter your answer:** 

$\text{P}_1=$  _____ $\text{kN}$

$\text{P}_2=$  _____ $\text{kN}$

### **Variable Parameters**

$[A]:$ Range (6, 10), in steps of 1

$[B]:$ Range (3, 5), in steps of 1

$[C]:[C]=6\times[A]/2$ 

$[D]:[D]=6\times[B]/2$ 

# Answer:

$[C],[D]$

# Feedback:

The magnitude of the equivalent resultant force is equal to the area of the shape that describes the distributed loading. In this question, the shape is divided into two triangles. Thus, the area of the green triangle ****is: $\frac{[A]~\text{kN/m}~(6~\text{m})}{2}=[C]~\text{kN}=\text{P}_1$. The area of the red triangle is: $\frac{[B]~\text{kN/m}~(6~\text{m})}{2}=[D]~\text{kN}=\text{P}_2$.  This distributed load could have also been divided into a rectangle and a triangle.  The total of (a different) $\text{P}_1$ and $\text{P}_2$ would have been the same.
