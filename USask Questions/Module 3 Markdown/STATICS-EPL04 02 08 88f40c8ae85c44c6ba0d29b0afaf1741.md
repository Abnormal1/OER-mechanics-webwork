# Question:

Consider the uniform triangular plate in the diagram below with the given centre of gravity (COG) and weight (force due to gravity) shown:

![STATICS-EPL04%2002%2008%2088f40c8ae85c44c6ba0d29b0afaf1741/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL04%2002%2008%2088f40c8ae85c44c6ba0d29b0afaf1741/Untitled.png)

If the plate has an area mass density of $12.5\,\mathrm{kg/m^2}$, what is the correct **magnitude** of the weight (force due to gravity)? Submit your answer to three significant figures:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=\,\_\_\_\_\_\,\,\mathrm{N}$$

# Answer:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=\underline\bold{405}\,\mathrm{N}$$

# Feedback:

When an **area mass density** is given (in $\mathrm{kg/m^2}$), it must be multiplied by the area of the surface of the plate to find the actual mass of the object (and the dimensions must match):

$$A_\mathrm{triangle}=(\mathrm{base}\times\mathrm{height})\div2=(2\,\mathrm{m}\times3.3\,\mathrm{m})/2$$

$$m_\mathrm{plate}= 12.5\,\mathrm{kg/m^2}\times A_\mathrm{triangle}$$

Then, the mass of the plate, $m_\mathrm{plate}$, can be multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity,  $g=9.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$, to get the magnitude of the weight, or the force due to gravity:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=m_\mathrm{plate}{g}$$

Don't forget to round your answer to **three** significant digits!
