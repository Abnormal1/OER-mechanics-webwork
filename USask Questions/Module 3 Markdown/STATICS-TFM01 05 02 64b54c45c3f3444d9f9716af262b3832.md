Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below, a truss is supported by a pin at $A$ and a roller at $B$. Is this truss structure statically determinate?

# Answer:

Yes

# Feedback:

A structure is considered statically determinate if all of its support reactions can be solved using the available equations of equilibrium. For the truss in this question, there are 3 unknown reactions i.e. $\text{B}_y$, $\text{A}_y$, and $\text{A}_y$, and they can be solved by $\sum{\text{M}_A=0}$, $\sum{\text{F}_y=0}$, and $\sum{\text{F}_x=0}$, respectively. Thus, this truss is statically determinate.
