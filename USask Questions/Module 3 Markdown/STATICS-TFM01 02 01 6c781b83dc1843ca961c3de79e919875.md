# Question:

What are truss structures typically used for? (Select all that apply)

a. roofs

b. furniture

c. dams

d. bridges

# Feedback:

a. Well done! This is one of the correct answers. Trusses are commonly used in buildings and bridges. 

b. Furniture usually has various interesting shapes, and the point of action of the forces are not always applied at the joints. Trusses are commonly used in larger scale structures like buildings and bridges. 

c. Water pressure is applied laterally to the dam. Trusses are better with carrying axial loads than lateral loads.

d. Well done! This is one of the correct answers. Trusses are commonly used in buildings and bridges.
