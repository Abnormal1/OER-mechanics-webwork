### General

The ZFMs of a truss can be identified by analyzing the FBD at each joint. See the FBDs at joint $C$ and joint $G$ below. $\bold{F_{BC}}$ and $\bold{F_{FG}}$ are the only forces in the y-direction at each joint. So Member BC and FG must be ZFMs, otherwise the joints can not be in equilibrium. This scenario can be generalized as: *if a joint is connected to **three** members, and two of the members are collinear, then the third member must be a ZFM given there is no other force acting on this joint.* 

Note joint D has the same connection, but since there is an external force acting vertically at this joint, Member DE is not a ZFM.
