# Question:

Consider the uniform beam in the diagram below:

![STATICS-EPL03%2001%2004%209dd0271518a44462815110f60c780cd0/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL03%2001%2004%209dd0271518a44462815110f60c780cd0/Untitled.png)

In the blanks below, enter the location of the **centre of gravity (COG)** of the beam in terms of depth, length, and height (measuring from the back, lower, left corner of the beam).  Submit your answers in whole numbers):

Depth ($x$ direction) = __________ in.

Length ($y$ direction) = __________ in.

Height ($z$ direction) = ___________ in.

# Answer:

Depth ($x$ direction) = **2** in.

Length ($y$ direction) = **12** in.

Height ($z$ direction) = **3** in.

# Feedback:

For a uniform object, the centre of gravity (COG) is in the **geometric centre**. For a rectangular beam in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the depth ($x$), length ($y$), and height ($z$). To find the distances to the COG, simply divide the full dimensions by 2 in each direction.
