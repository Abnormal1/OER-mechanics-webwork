# Feedback:

a) Correct! This option shows the COG in the centre of the length ($y$ direction), width ($x$ direction), and height ($z$ direction) of the plate. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a square plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the face of the plate ($x$ and $y$ direction) as well as the middle of the height of the plate ($z$ direction). 

b) This option shows the COG in the centre of the length ($y$ direction) and width ($x$ direction) of the plate, but it's located at the **bottom of the plate** ($z=0\,\mathrm{m}$). For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a square plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the face of the plate ($x$ and $y$ direction) **as well as** the middle of the height ($z$ direction). 

c) This option shows the COG in the centre of the length ($y$ direction) and width ($x$ direction) of the plate, but it's located at the **top of the plate** ($z=0.2\,\mathrm{m}$). For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a square plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the face of the plate ($x$ and $y$ direction) **as well as** the middle of the height ($z$ direction). 

d) This option shows the COG on a corner of the plate, not in the centre of any of the dimensions. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. For a square plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the face of the plate ($x$ and $y$ direction), and the middle of the height ($z$ direction).
