j. There are ZFMs in this case. See below for the solution of this question.

### General

The ZFMs in a truss can be identified by analyzing the FBD at each joint. As shown in the FBD at joint $A$ below, no force can cancel out the y-component of $\bold{F_{AB}}$, thus $\bold{F_{AB}}$ must be a ZFM. Then $\bold{F_{AC}}$ becomes the only force in the x-direction. Thus, $\bold{F_{AC}}$ is also a ZFM. This scenario can be generalized as: *if a joint is connected to only **two non-collinear** members, and there is no other force acting on it, then these two members must be ZFMs.*
