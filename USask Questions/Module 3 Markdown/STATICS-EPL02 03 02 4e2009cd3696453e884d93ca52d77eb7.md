# Question:

A beam is subjected to a triangular distributed load, and the peak of the load $w_1=[A]~\text{kN/m}$. If the triangular loading is divided into two right triangles as shown in the bottom figure, determine the magnitudes of the equivalent resultant forces of each right triangles.

**Enter your answer:** 

$\text{P}_1=$  _____ $\text{kN}$

$\text{P}_2=$  _____ $\text{kN}$

### **Variable Parameters**

$[A]:$ Range (3, 10), in steps of 1

$[C]:[C]=3\times[A]/2$ 

$[D]:[D]=6\times[A]/2$ 

# Answer:

$[C],[D]$

# Feedback:

The magnitude of the equivalent resultant force is equal to the area of the shape that describes the distributed loading. In this question, the shape is divided into two right triangles. Thus, the area of the triangle on the left-hand side ****is: $\frac{[A]~\text{kN/m}~(3~\text{m})}{2}=[C]~\text{kN}=\text{P}_1$. The area of the triangle on the right-hand side is: $\frac{[A]~\text{kN/m}~(6~\text{m})}{2}=[D]~\text{kN}=\text{P}_2$.  Note that we could have found one equivalent resultant force in one step by multiplying the peak distribution value times the overall length (9 m) and dividing that product by two.  In other words, we could have calculated the area under both triangles in one step.
