# Question:

Consider the 2D representation of a car in the diagram below with the given centre of gravity (COG) and force due to gravity (weight) shown (going into the page):

![STATICS-EPL04%2003%2004%2077ddedfe4e2740438b0f92d455223085/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL04%2003%2004%2077ddedfe4e2740438b0f92d455223085/Untitled.png)

If the car has a mass of $62.71\,\mathrm{slugs}$, what is the correct **magnitude** of the weight? Submit your answer to three significant figures:

$$|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=\,\_\_\_\_\_\times10^3\,\mathrm{lb}$$

# Answer:

$$|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=\underline\bold{2.02}\times10^3\,\mathrm{lb}$$

# Feedback:

This problem is in imperial units. A **slug** is the imperial unit of mass, and it has a weight of approximately $32.2\,\mathrm{lb}$ in standard Earth gravity.  Acceleration due to gravity is $32.2\,\mathrm{ft/s^2}$ in imperial units, and force is measured in $\mathrm{lbs}$. 

To find the weight of an object, even a complex one, the mass must be multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity,  $g=32.2\,\mathrm{ft/s^2}$:

$$|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=m{g}$$

Don't forget to round your answer to **three** significant digits!
