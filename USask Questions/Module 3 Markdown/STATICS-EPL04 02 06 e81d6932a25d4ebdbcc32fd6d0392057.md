# Question:

Consider the uniform circular plate in the diagram below with the given centre of gravity (COG) and weight (force due to gravity) shown:

![STATICS-EPL04%2002%2006%20e81d6932a25d4ebdbcc32fd6d0392057/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL04%2002%2006%20e81d6932a25d4ebdbcc32fd6d0392057/Untitled.png)

If the plate has an area mass density of $3.75\,\mathrm{kg/m^2}$, what is the correct **magnitude** of the weight (force due to gravity)? Submit your answer to three significant figures:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=\,\_\_\_\_\_\,\,\mathrm{N}$$

# Answer:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=\underline\bold{906}\,\mathrm{N}$$

# Feedback:

When an **area mass density** is given (in $\mathrm{kg/m^2}$), it must be multiplied by the area of the surface of the plate to find the actual mass of the object (and the dimensions must match):

$$A_\mathrm{circle}=\pi r^2=\pi \times (2.8\,\mathrm{m})^2$$

$$m_\mathrm{plate}= 3.75\,\mathrm{kg/m^2}\times A_\mathrm{circle}$$

Then, the mass of the plate, $m_\mathrm{plate}$, can be multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity,  $g=9.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$, to get the magnitude of the weight, or the force due to gravity:

$$|\overrightarrow{W}|=m_\mathrm{plate}{g}$$

Don't forget to round your answer to **three** significant digits!
