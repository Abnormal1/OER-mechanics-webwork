Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

From the list below, select the incorrect statement about zero-force members (ZFMs). 

# Answer:

a. Truss analysis can be greatly simplified if we identify ZFMs early on.

b. We need to identify all the ZFMs in a truss, so we can remove them from the design.  

c. ZFMs in one loading situation may not be ZFMs in other loading situations. 

d. ZFMs can increase the stability of a structure. 

# Feedback:

a. This is a correct statement. ZFMs can be identified without calculation. By removing them early on, you are left with less members to consider. However, this question is asking you to identify the incorrect statement. 

b. Good job! This is the incorrect statement. ZFMs in one loading situation may not be ZFMs in others. Plus they can increase the stability of the structure. 

c. This is a correct statement. ZFMs in one loading situation may not be ZFMs in others. Plus they can increase the stability of the structure. However, this question is asking you to identify the incorrect statement. 

d. This is a correct statement. ZFMs in one loading situation may not be ZFMs in others. Plus they can increase the stability of the structure. However, this question is asking you to identify the incorrect statement.
