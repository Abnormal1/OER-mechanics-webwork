Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

Which one of the following equations is for calculating the kinetic frictional force?

# Answer:

a. $F_s=\mu_sN$

b. $F_k=\mu_kN$

c. $\sum F=0$

# Feedback:

a. This is for calculating the maximum static frictional force. 

b. Good job! This is the equation for calculating the kinetic frictional force.

c. This can be used to calculate the static and kinetic frictional forces when the object is in **static or dynamic equilibrium**.
