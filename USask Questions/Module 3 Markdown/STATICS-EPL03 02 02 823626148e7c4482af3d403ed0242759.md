# Question:

Consider the uniform square plate in the diagram below:

![STATICS-EPL03%2002%2002%20823626148e7c4482af3d403ed0242759/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL03%2002%2002%20823626148e7c4482af3d403ed0242759/Untitled.png)

In the blanks below, enter the location of the **centre of gravity (COG)** of the plate in terms of width, length, and height (measuring from the origin of the coordinate system as shown).  Submit your answers in whole numbers:

Width ($x$ direction) = __________ ft

Length ($y$ direction) = __________ ft

Height ($z$ direction) = ___________ ft

# Answer:

Width ($x$ direction) = **16** ft

Length ($y$ direction) = **16** ft

Height ($z$ direction) = **1** ft

# Feedback:

For a uniform object, the centre of gravity (COG) is in the **geometric centre**. For a square plate in 3D, this means the COG is located in the middle of the width ($x$), length ($y$), and height ($z$). To find the distances to the COG, simply divide the full dimensions by 2 in each direction.
