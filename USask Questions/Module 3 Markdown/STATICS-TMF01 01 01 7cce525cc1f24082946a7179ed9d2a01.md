Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question：

Which one of the following is the correct definition of a truss?

# Answer：

a. A truss is a structure made of slender two-force members joined at end points.

b. A truss is a structure made of pin-connected slender members.

c. A truss is typically used for bridges and buildings (roofs).

d. A truss is made of pin-connected multi-force members.

# Feedback：

a. Well done! This is the correct definition of a truss. 

b. While a truss is assumed to be pin-connected in our analyses, this option does not specify that all truss members are **2FMs**. 

c. This statement correct states the uses of a truss, but not the **definition** of it. 

d. This is the definition of a frame, not a truss. All truss members need to be **2FMs.**
