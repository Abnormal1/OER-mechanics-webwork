Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

Which one of the following statements is correct about dry friction when there is no apparent impending motion?

# Answer:

a. The number of unknowns will be **less than** the number of available equations (equilibrium equations plus friction equations or tipping equations)

b. The number of unknowns will be **equal to** the number of available equations (equilibrium equations plus friction equations or tipping equations)

c. The number of unknowns will be **more than** the number of available equations (equilibrium equations plus friction equations or tipping equations)

# Feedback:

a. When an object has no impending motion, it is in static equilibrium. Thus, the number of unknowns will be **equal to** the number of available equations. 

b. Good job! When an object has no impending motion, it is in static equilibrium. Thus, the number of unknowns will be **equal to** the number of available equations. 

c. When an object has no impending motion, it is in static equilibrium. Thus, the number of unknowns will be **equal to** the number of available equations.
