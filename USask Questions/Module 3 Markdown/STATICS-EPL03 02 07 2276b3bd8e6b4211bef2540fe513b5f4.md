# Question:

Consider the uniform triangular plate in the diagram below:

![STATICS-EPL03%2002%2007%202276b3bd8e6b4211bef2540fe513b5f4/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL03%2002%2007%202276b3bd8e6b4211bef2540fe513b5f4/Untitled.png)

Note that this is an isosceles triangle, with two sides having the same length. Select the diagram that shows the correct placement of the **centre of gravity (COG)** of this uniform triangular plate:

# Feedback:

a) This option shows the COG a third of the way along the length of the triangle ($x$ direction) and halfway along the base ($y$ direction), but it's located at the **bottom of the plate**. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. The geometric centre of an isosceles triangle is 1/3 of the length from the base aligned half way along the base, but because this is a triangular plate in 3D, the COG is **also** in the middle of the plate. 

b) Correct! This option shows the COG a third of the way along the length of the triangle ($x$ direction), halfway along the base ($y$ direction), and in the middle of the plate ($z$ direction). For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. The geometric centre of an isosceles triangle is 1/3 of the length from the base aligned half way along the base. Because this is a triangular plate in 3D, the COG is also in the middle of the plate. 

c) This option shows the COG a third of the way along the length of the triangle ($x$ direction) and halfway along the base ($y$ direction), but it's located at the **top of the plate**. For a uniform object, the COG is in the **geometric centre**. The geometric centre of an isosceles triangle is 1/3 of the length from the base aligned half way along the base, but because this is a triangular plate in 3D, the COG is **also** in the middle of the plate. 

d) Almost! This option shows the COG **halfway** along the length of the triangle ($x$ direction), halfway along the base ($y$ direction), and in the middle of the plate ($z$ direction). The geometric centre of an isosceles triangle is **one third** of the length from the base aligned half way along the base. Because this is a triangular plate in 3D, the COG is also in the middle of the plate, which is correct here.
