Topic/ Unit: Determine forces in members of a truss using the MoJ and MoS and calculate forces acting on members of frames and machines in 2D (TFM)

# Question:

If you want to calculate the force in member AB, would you use the Method of Joints or the Method of Sections?

# Answer:

a. Method of Joints

b. Method of Sections

c. Either is fine

d. A combination of both

# Feedback:

a. Usually, using the Method of Sections is more efficient when you only need to solve for **a few** members in a truss. However, in this case, $\bold{F_{AB}}$ can be solved in just one step using the FBD at joint $A$.  Thus, either method is fine to use.

b. Usually, using the Method of Sections is more efficient when you only need to solve for **a few** members in a truss. However, in this case, $\bold{F_{AB}}$ can be solved in just one step using the FBD at joint $A$.  Thus, either method is fine to use.

c. Good job! Usually, using the Method of Sections is more efficient when you only need to solve for **a few** members in a truss. However, in this case, $\bold{F_{AB}}$ can be solved in just one step using the FBD at joint $A$.  Thus, either method is fine to use.

d. Usually, using the Method of Sections is more efficient when you only need to solve for **a few** members in a truss. However, in this case, $\bold{F_{AB}}$ can be solved in just one step using the FBD at joint $A$.  Thus, either method is fine to use. You certainly don't need a combination of both.
