# Feedback:

a. The equivalent resultant force should go through the centroid of the area that describes the distributed loading. For a triangular distributed load, its equivalent resultant load is located at 1/3 of the distance from the larger end. That's $12-\frac{6~\text{m}}{3}=10~\text{m}$ from the left end of the beam for this question, **NOT** the middle of the beam.

d. Well done! The equivalent resultant force should go through the centroid of the area that describes the distributed loading.
