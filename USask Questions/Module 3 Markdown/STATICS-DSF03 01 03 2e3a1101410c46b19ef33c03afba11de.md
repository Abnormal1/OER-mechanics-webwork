Topic/ Unit: Determine the equilibrium of a rigid body subjected to dry static friction resulting in no (or impending tip or slip) movement considering the rigid body's center of gravity (DSF)

# Question:

As shown in the figure below, an object is sitting on an inclined surface. Given the object is in a state of impending motion, which one of the following changes will break the equilibrium?

# Answer:

a. increase $\theta$

b. decrease $\theta$

c. increase the weight of the object

d. decrease the weight of the object. 

# Feedback:

a. Good job!  If the surface is more inclined, the object will start to slide down or tip. See below for more explanation.

b. If the surface is less inclined, the object will become static **without** impending motion. See below for more explanation.

c. If an object sitting on an inclined surface is in equilibrium, changing its weight will not break the equilibrium. See below for more explanation.

d.  If an object sitting on an inclined surface is in equilibrium, changing its weight will not break the equilibrium. See below for more explanation.

### General feedback:

See the FBD below.

The maximum static frictional force is $F_s=\mu_sN=\mu_s(W\cos\theta)$

The weight component parallel to the surface is $W\sin\theta$

If the object is in a state of impending motion, the static frictional force is at its maximum and is equal to the weight component parallel to the surface:

$$‚Åç$$

Divide both sides by $W\cos\theta$,

$$\mu_s=\tan\theta$$

We can see that the maximum angle at which the object can remain at rest solely depends on the static coefficient of friction, $\mu_s$. The weight of the object is completely irrelevant. Also, if $\theta$ is increased, then $\tan{\theta}$ increases.  But $\mu_s$ doesn't change.  So motion happens.
