# Question:

Consider the symmetrical silhouette of a house below, where our assumption of symmetry covers both the shape and the density of the two sides of the house:

![STATICS-EPL03%2003%2003%20b0feb8526fe246059010b6671d5bb44f/Untitled.png](STATICS-EPL03%2003%2003%20b0feb8526fe246059010b6671d5bb44f/Untitled.png)

The dotted red line represents the **midline** of this 2D shape. From the options below, select the diagram that **does not show** a possibly correct placement for the centre of gravity (COG) on this complex house shape:

# Feedback:

a) Well done! Although we don't know the exact location vertically of the COG, we do know it is on the **midline** of a complex symmetrical shape such as the one above. This is the only option that shows a COG that is not on the midline, and therefore, it cannot be a correct COG. 

b) This option shows a COG that is **on the midline**. While we do not the exact location of the COG vertically, we know that it must be on the midline due to the symmetry of the shape. Choose the option that **does not show** a possibly correct placement for the centre of gravity on this object. 

c) This option shows a COG that is **on the midline**. While we do not the exact location of the COG vertically, we know that it must be on the midline due to the symmetry of the shape. Choose the option that **does not show** a possibly correct placement for the centre of gravity on this object. 

d) This option shows a COG that is **on the midline**. While we do not the exact location of the COG vertically, we know that it must be on the midline due to the symmetry of the shape. Choose the option that **does not show** a possibly correct placement for the centre of gravity on this object.
